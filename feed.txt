      "text": "Housing Starts Pause After Hefty Gains; Building Permits Soar By REUTERS JUNE 16, 2015, 9:02 A.M. E.D.T. Inside Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — U.S. housing starts fell in May after a hefty increase the prior month, but a surge in permits for future construction to a near eight-year high pointed to underlying strength in housing. The steadily firming housing market, marked by rising home prices and sales, is likely to be acknowledged by Federal Reserve officials, who were preparing to gather for a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Policymakers have repeatedly singled out housing as one of the weak spots in the economy. The U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates later this year. It has kept its short-term lending rate near zero since December 2008. Groundbreaking dropped 11.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.04 mullion units, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. That partially reversed April's large gain. April starts were revised up to a 1.17 million-unit rate, the highest since November 2007. Economists had forecast housing starts falling to a 1.10 million-unit pace last month after April's previously reported 1.14 million-unit rate. Permits for future home building increased 11.8 percent to a 1.28 million-unit rate, the highest since August 2007. It was the second straight month of increase. Permits have been above a 1 million-unit pace since July. The dollar extended gains against the euro. U.S. government debt prices were little moved. Home building has regained ground lost during a harsh winter and there are signs activity will accelerate this year as tightening labor market conditions spur strong wage gains and encourage young adults to move from their parents' basements. A survey on Monday showed confidence among builders vaulting to a nine-month high in June, with measures of both current sales and buyer traffic increasing solidly. Economists anticipate that the housing market will strengthen enough to take up some of the slack from the struggling manufacturing sector and support economic growth. Groundbreaking for single-family homes, which account for the largest share of the market, fell 5.4 percent to a 680,000 unit pace. Starts for the volatile multifamily segment tumbled 20.2 percent to a 356,000 unit rate. Groundbreaking fell in all four regions, declining a steep 26.5 percent in the Northeast after April's spectacular gains. Starts in the South, where most of the home building takes place, fell 5.0 percent. Single-family building permits increased 2.6 percent to their highest level since December. Multi-family building permits soared 24.9 percent. Permits for buildings with five units or more increased to their highest level since January 1990. The multifamily sector is being driven by demand for rental accommodation as more people move away from homeownership. (Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci) Loading... ",

      "text": " The poet Carl Sandburg called him America’s tuning fork, and for good reason.\nPete Seeger drew upon many traditions of American folk music, from spirituals to mountain music, throughout the almost eight decades he sang, wrote and collected songs. By the time he died at 94 last year , nearly every region of the United States could lay claim to him.\nIt was in North Carolina, for example, where in 1936 he first heard the five-string banjo, which would become his instrument of choice, at a square dance festival.\nThere he was at Bowdoin College in Maine in 1960, performing his protest song “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?” after he had been blacklisted from national venues and indicted on a charge of contempt of Congress because of his political affiliations, including membership in the Communist Party in the 1940s.\nIn Hattiesburg, Miss., hand-in-hand with churchgoers in 1964, he led rounds of “We Shall Overcome,” which he adapted from old spirituals.\n Related Coverage Pete Seeger, Champion of Folk Music and Social Change, Dies at 94 JAN. 28, 2014 For Seeger, Years of Singing and Sailing to Save His Hudson River JAN. 28, 2014 In Search of Woody Guthrie’s America NOV. 22, 2013 Roaming Through Woody Guthrie’s New York SEPT. 18, 2014 And in 2009 in Washington, D.C., Mr. Seeger gave Americans what was likely their last memory of him: The beanpole-thin 89-year-old implored thousands to join him in singing Woody Guthrie ’s “This Land Is Your Land” at the Lincoln Memorial at President Obama’s Inaugural concert.\nPhoto The townhouse on West 10th Street where Mr. Seeger and his band lived. Credit Tony Cenicola/The New York Times Considering the many places his music took him, you would be forgiven for forgetting that, in a deeply rooted sense, Mr. Seeger was a New Yorker. It was Greenwich Village that made him, in the early 1940s, the musician who would champion the American folk music revival. And in Beacon, N.Y., about 65 miles north, he later became an environmental activist, working tirelessly to clean up the Hudson River.\nRaised on his children’s songs, I had always been a fan of Mr. Seeger and of the many folk artists he influenced, from Peter, Paul and Mary to the tradition’s great innovator, Bob Dylan.\nBut lately I encountered folk music only in hyphenation with some other genre like alternative, rock or country. This summer folk-rock bands and singer-songwriters like the Decemberists and Neko Case will gather at events, including the Newport Folk Festival, July 24 to 26, or the Clearwater Festival , which Mr. Seeger helped found, on June 20 and 21 in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.\nBut where does folk music reside year-round? Setting out to explore Mr. Seeger’s old haunts in Manhattan and Beacon, I hoped to stumble upon a scene alive with his spirit.\nThough Mr. Seeger was born in Manhattan in 1919, the son of a well-to-do musicologist and concert violinist, and the family had an estate in Patterson, N.Y., he spent his youth largely at a Connecticut boarding school. After losing his scholarship to Harvard in 1938, he also briefly moved into his brother’s apartment at 118 East 11th Street, opposite Webster Hall , where he would headline in the early 1950s.\nAdvertisement\n But in 1940 Mr. Seeger was still an amateur banjo player who had just returned to New York after a stint cataloging and transcribing folk music at the Library of Congress. It was his friend the folklorist Alan Lomax who had pulled him into an eclectic group of folk musicians, like the Kentuckian singer and union activist Aunt Molly Jackson and the Louisiana-born Huddie Ledbetter, better known as Lead Belly, who taught Mr. Seeger the 12-string guitar.\nThese musicians orbited in and around Greenwich Village. It was in Mr. Ledbetter’s tenement apartment at 414 East 10th Street that Mr. Seeger first heard the blues singer’s haunting rendition of “Goodnight Irene,” a folk standard Mr. Seeger would later turn into a sanitized pop hit with the Weavers in 1950.\n“Lead Belly knew hundreds of songs and introduced them to Pete,” said Stephen Petrus, an author of “Folk City,” which accompanies an exhibition by the same name at the Museum of the City of New York through Nov. 29.\nThis was the Greenwich Village before youth counterculture took root in the late 1950s. It was before Bob Dylan crooned “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” in the Gaslight Cafe on Macdougal Street (now the craft cocktail bar Up & Up) . It was before the Village attained a mythic status, evoked in the 2013 film “ Inside Llewyn Davis .”\nIn the early 1940s, the neighborhood was largely an immigrant enclave, and folk music was still played mostly in people’s homes, or studied by the likes of Mr. Seeger’s father.\nIt was Mr. Seeger’s generation who brought folk songs out of their homes and to the workers. They played in union halls and at labor rallies.\nOne important address was the Forrest Theater on West 49th Street (now the Eugene O’Neill Theater), where in 1940 Mr. Seeger made his first public performance, fumbling through the ballad “John Hardy,” at the “Grapes of Wrath” benefit concert for Dust Bowl migrants. There he also encountered Woody Guthrie, the scrappy Okie songster who would become his mentor.\nAfter crisscrossing the country on freight trains, Mr. Seeger returned to New York and helped found the Almanac Singers, a ragtag group of a dozen musicians, including Lee Hays and Millard Lampell, who aimed to start a singing union movement.\nNot before long, though, World War II broke out, and their repertory turned patriotic. To pay the rent for the three-story townhouse the whole band shared at 130 West 10th Street, named the Almanac House, they performed hootenannies in the basement, rattling out unionist and anti-Hitler tunes.\nAdvertisement\n (The shy Mr. Seeger never fully embraced communal living; in “Singing Out,” by David King Dunaway and Molly Beer, the musician Bess Lomax Hawes recalled sharing a bedroom with him with a sheet hung down the middle, “in perfect sobriety.”)\nThe Almanac House, now a veterinary clinic and apartments, still draws a number of passers-by thanks to an audio tour of Mr. Guthrie’s homes, produced by his granddaughter, that guides you to it.\nOne former home of Mr. Seeger that is open to the public is at 129 Macdougal Street. His in-laws’ townhouse, where he lived with his wife, Toshi, and their young children after he returned from World War II, is now an Italian restaurant, La Lanterna di Vittorio.\nLast month I had a cappuccino on its lovely back patio with Mr. Seeger’s grandson Kitama Cahill Jackson. We sat amid what we guessed was an N.Y.U. student’s graduation celebration, and Mr. Jackson showed me photos of Mr. Seeger there, when it was a simple backyard, strumming on his banjo with Mr. Guthrie and others.\n Video ‘To Hear Your Banjo Play’ Pete Seeger plays at a square dance in an edited clip of the 1946 film, “To Hear Your Banjo Play.”\nPublish Date January 28, 2014. Photo by Richard Leacock. “My great-grandmother created an open house,” Mr. Jackson said, adding that Toshi’s parents encouraged Pete and his friends to gather and rehearse there. Sitting there for a moment, I could almost conjure the bohemian spirit of those days.\nAdvertisement\n A scene in the 2007 documentary film “Pete Seeger: The Power of Song,” though, drained some color from my roseate image. The Seegers, in their 80s, are strolling through Washington Square Park nearby, and I expected Pete to begin reminiscing about his days busking by the fountain. Instead Toshi speaks.\n“I used to come out here at 5 o’clock every morning because you got in from the Village Vanguard at 4,” she says. “The babies would wake you up, so I took them out into the park, all by myself at 5 in the morning.”\n“Never thought of that,” Mr. Seeger begins to admit, just as a fan rushes to thank him for his music.\nToday Beacon is a city of 15,000 known for its Victorian town center and its artsy spirit. But in 1949, when Mr. Seeger moved his family there, it was a small industrial city, and he sought a life with few luxuries.\nOn a hilltop at the town’s edge, he built, with his bare hands, a one-room log cabin where he and his family lived without running water or electricity. Later a bigger house was built a few yards away. Both remain in the family, but you can get a sense of Mr. Seeger’s view of the Hudson from the side of Mount Beacon. Hike to its top for an even more spectacular vantage point.\nAdvertisement\n From Beacon, beginning in the late 1960s, Mr. Seeger spearheaded an effort to clean up the Hudson, what he lovingly called in a song “my dirty stream.” At the time, its waters, ravaged by industrial waste, oil and sewage, were so poisonous that, according to the environmental activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., wooden boats from the Caribbean would sail upriver to kill the bore worms that were damaging their hulls.\nMr. Seeger’s idea was to build the Clearwater, a 106-foot sloop based on a century-old design, believing that the majestic boat would throw the Hudson’s ugly toxicity in sharp relief and force people to pay attention it. To lobby for the Clean Water Act of 1972, he sailed it to Washington and serenaded members of Congress.\nToday the Clearwater is still sailing. Along the Hudson, from the West 79th Street Boat Basin in Manhattan to Rensselaer, a city opposite Albany, it sets out for expeditions that are open to the public through September.\nI missed the sloop during my visit to Beacon last month (it was on its way to Kingston, N.Y.), and no one I met at Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, the nonprofit that Mr. Seeger helped found and which operates the boat, rushed to make me feel better about the missed opportunity.\n“It’s a feeling like nothing else,” the organization’s communications director, Toni Martin, said of sailing on the Hudson.\nStill, a Sunday afternoon at the Beacon Sloop Club , another organization Mr. Seeger helped to start, brought me closer to the river than I ever had been in New York City. Its clubhouse sits in a beautiful waterfront park, named after the Seegers last year, just north of the contemporary art museum Dia: Beacon .\nOn that bright blue day, it was hard to imagine the river had ever reeked like a sewer. I stood on the riverbank, a slight breeze coming off the water, and marveled at its breadth. From here, it is a mile wide.\nJust about any restaurant or shop along Main Street could be included in a tour of Mr. Seeger’s life, he was such a reliable presence in the town. But that day was Mr. Seeger’s 96th birthday, and a tribute concert was scheduled at the Towne Crier Cafe, so I headed there.\nAlongside rock and country, the venue often has folk acts, including the singer-songwriter Peter Yarrow, of Peter, Paul & Mary, on July 17. It felt like a throwback to the Village cafe culture, serving well-prepared food and drinks during concerts.\nAnd down the block I had noticed Main Street Music , which sells new and vintage string instruments and holds open jam sessions every second Saturday of the month. Perhaps New York’s folk scene had simply moved upriver?\nAdvertisement\n Over the phone a few weeks later, Mr. Petrus said the most vibrant folk community he has come across is in Red Hook, Brooklyn, centered around the Jalopy Theater and School of Music, a co-organizer of the Brooklyn Folk Festival each April.\nThough the venue does have folk artists from Mr. Seeger’s era like Michael Hurley, it focuses on pre-revival music from this country and the world, including the bluegrass Matt Flinner Trio or the Zimbabwean-influenced Polyphony Marimba.\nPhoto Pete and Toshi Seeger Riverfront Park in Beacon, N.Y. Credit Tony Cenicola/The New York Times But, he added, folk artists were always at home in eclectic spaces like the Towne Crier. They performed alongside flamenco dancers and jazz musicians at the Village Gate, now Le Poisson Rouge , and comedians at the Bitter End .\n“That’s always been the spirit of folk,” he said. “It’s such a baggy term, and it blends with so many different strands of music.”\nBack at the concert at the Towne Crier, the performer Reggie Harris told me that while he was heartened to see folk music live on, he feared that “as a society, we’ve gotten away from collective song.” Singers now focus on performing their own songs, not sharing them, he said.\nBut perhaps the moment is ripe for another revival, he added. While demonstrators in Baltimore; Ferguson, Mo.; and New York have relied on chants like “I Can’t Breathe,” he has encouraged members of the Black Lives Matter organization to create simple, singable songs, as Mr. Seeger and others had done in the civil rights movement.\n“We know that as we sing together, we breathe together,” he said, “and that changes the air.”\nThe concert was starting, so I took my seat for the first performers, an acoustic trio. At the last rock show I had been to, people did not so much as tap their feet, so I was a bit flustered when suddenly the whole room was singing in unison.\nBut the tune was hummable, and the lyrics easy, so I sang along, “Won’t you raise your voice with mine?”\nIf You Go In New York City To understand the history of folk music in the city, particularly in Greenwich Village, head to the Museum of the City of New York (1220 Fifth Avenue at East 103rd Street; mcny.org ) for “Folk City: New York and the Folk Music Revival,” which runs to Nov. 29. It features items like Lead Belly’s 12-string guitar and several of Bob Dylan’s manuscripts, including “Blowin’ in the Wind.”\nTo learn about life in the Almanac House at 130 West 10th Street, buy the audio walking tour of Woody Guthrie’s life in New York, “My Name Is New York” ( woodyguthrie.org ).\n Have a speck-covered pizza ($15) or a tiramisù ($6.50) in Mr. Seeger’s former home, now La Lanterna di Vittorio (129 Macdougal Street at West Third Street; lalanternacaffe.com ).\nThe Village Vanguard (178 Seventh Avenue South at West 11th Street; villagevanguard.com ), where Mr. Seeger often performed with the Weavers, now features mostly jazz acts.\nFor current folk acts as well as lessons in guitar and banjo, check out the Jalopy Theater and School of Music (315 Columbia Street; jalopy.bi z) in Red Hook, Brooklyn. In April it co-hosts the Brooklyn Folk Festival.\nIn Beacon, N.Y. Bed-and-breakfasts include the Swann Inn (from $155.50; swanninnofbeacon .com ); Mount Beacon (from $180; mtbeaconbedandbreakfast .com ); and Chrystie House (from $175; chrystiehouse .com ). I tried Airbnb.com and stayed in a cottage for $199.\nIn a former factory overlooking Beacon Falls, the Roundhouse ( roundhousebeacon.com ) offers guest rooms starting at $189 (midweek) and a restaurant serving a farm-to-table menu.\nAt Towne Crier Cafe (379 Main Street; townecrier .com ) you can watch acts like the folk-rock band the Felice Brothers while eating dishes like brick chicken ($16.50).\nFor a schedule of the Clearwater on the Hudson, contact Hudson River Sloop Clearwater ( clearwater.org ). In town, it docks at the Beacon Sloop Club (2 Red Flynn Drive) in the Pete and Toshi Seeger Riverfront Park. The Clearwater Festival ( clearwaterfestival.org ), also known as the Great Hudson River Revival, takes place on June 20 and 21 in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. This year’s lineup includes folk and rock artists like David Crosby, Citizen Cope and Los Lobos.",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Hail, dancegoers. Here is another installment of our weekly dance column, in which we draw attention to highlights in the field. This weekend, New York dance fans have important events uptown and downtown. If you time things right, you can see choreography by Merce Cunningham , Trisha Brown and Twyla Tharp in three (or even two) consecutive days, and catch American Ballet Theater’s “Romeo and Juliet,” which involves both debuts and departures. Please use the comments section to let us know what you think.\nMerce Cunningham’s “Crises” at the Whitney\nAfter revivals of Merce Cunningham’s “RainForest,” “Doubles,” “BIPED” and other dances this winter and spring, will New York look back on 2015 as an annus mirabilis for his work? The first four dance performances of “Crises” at the new Whitney Museum occur this weekend — two on Friday (2 p.m. and 7 p.m.) and two on Saturday (2 p.m. and 4 p.m.). The cast is one of seasoned Cunningham dancers, and they bring a revival of his 1960 work “ Crises ” — one of his most haunting dramas. Its opening image shows us a woman seemingly controlled by opposed impulses. Standing on one leg, she slowly extends a leg with apparent fluency, and yet her upper body churns, uneasily wracked by spasms. In this work, Cunningham made his women strong (even wild, perhaps witchlike) and independent.\nThe score is by Conlon Nancarrow, and these performances are part of a Whitney festival of his work. Cunningham died in 2009. His company (at his behest) closed in 2011.\nTwyla Tharp’s “The One Hundreds” and “Trisha Brown: In Plain Sight” in the open air\nTwyla Tharp — to my mind one of the three living choreographers who have achieved true greatness (the others are Paul Taylor and Mark Morris) — this year celebrates her 50 th anniversary as a choreographer. On Saturday, as part of the River to River Festival, she revives her rare 1970 dance “ The One Hundreds ” in the open air at Nelson A. Rockefeller Park (Battery Park City). This piece comes from a different Tharp era — when she was working without music (or, she later said, not letting audiences hear the music to which the dance was made), often in nontheatrical spaces and in the same experimental way as the dance postmoderns.\nOne of Ms. Tharp’s foremost postmodern contemporaries was Trisha Brown, another pioneer of placing dances in unusual settings who choreographed her last dance in 2011. Sunday brings her company’s next site-specific offering (“ Trisha Brown: In Plain Sight ”) in Robert J. Wagner Jr. Park, (4 p.m. and 6 p.m.), also as part of the River to River Festival.\nPhoto Julie Kent in a 2010 performance of \"Romeo and Juliet.\" Credit Matthew Murphy for The New York Times Juliets Come, Juliets Go\nWith star casting of international consequence, American Ballet Theater’s week of Kenneth MacMillan’s “Romeo and Juliet” (Monday through Saturday) at the Metropolitan Opera House includes debuts and a farewell.

      "text": "Here’s what you need to know: • Militant leaders killed? Al Qaeda said today that Nasser al-Wuhayshi, its No. 2 figure and leader of its affiliate in Yemen, died in a U.S. missile strike. If true, it would be the biggest blow to the group since the killing of Osama bin Laden. A Libyan militant group released today a list of people it says died in a separate U.S. attack, but it did not include Mokhtar Belmokhtar , an extremist leader linked to Al Qaeda who some had said was killed. • Trying again on trade. The House may vote today on an extension for a bill to help workers who have been displaced by global trade agreements. That is tied to a package that would give President Obama fast-track authority to advance trade negotiations. • Benghazi panel meets again. Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of the Clintons, is scheduled to testify today about frequent emails about Libya he sent to Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was secretary of state. His messages raise questions about whether the State Department and Mrs. Clinton complied with a series of requests from the House panel investigating the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. • Disgraced rights advocate speaks. Rachel A. Dolezal did not back down this morning, stating “I identify as black,” although she comes from a white family. She spoke on the “Today” show, in her first interview since being accused of misrepresenting her racial background and stepping down as president of the N.A.A.C.P. chapter in Spokane, Wash. • Pope calls for urgent action on climate. Pope Francis urged people of all religions to take swift action to reduce the use of fossil fuels , according to a draft of his environmental encyclical. The Vatican warned that the document, posted online by an Italian magazine, did not represent the final version, due on Thursday. • “A big day for our country.” That’s what Donald Trump, 68, says about today , when he will announce his presidential intentions in New York. His financial disclosure forms, required of all candidates for president, will be closely read if he decides to run. Mr. Trump calls himself a billionaire, but some have questioned that. • Texas braces for more flooding. Up to 12 inches of rain could hit eastern Texas today as Tropical Storm Bill approaches the Gulf Coast. MARKETS • The Fed starts a two-day policy meeting today with odds against an interest rate rise. The big question for mortgage seekers and other rate watchers is whether an increase will come in September or October. • The clothing retailer Gap updates its turnaround plan today. It is shutting 175 stores, mostly in the U.S., and cutting 250 corporate jobs. • Wall Street stocks are in positive territory . European indexes are mixed, and Asian shares finished lower.

After it went 50 years without a title, the Chicago Blackhawks won their third Stanley Cup in six seasons by beating the Tampa Bay Lightning, 2-0, on Monday to end a tightly fought six-game hockey series. \nAdvertisement",

      "title": "Can Thulisile Madonsela Save South Africa From Itself?",
      "text": " O n a cloudy morning in March last year, dozens of reporters, photographers and camera crews gathered in the vast building that houses the offices of Thulisile Madonsela, South Africa’s public protector. The journalists assembled that day were searched by security, stripped of their phones, pens, notebooks and recording equipment and told to take a seat in a conference room. Madonsela’s staff gave each of them a thick document numbering almost 450 pages. Her assistants were posted by the windows, making sure no one was secretly leaking information. Outside, riot officers in armored vehicles stood watch. “There’s about 100 people in the room,” recalled Ranjeni Munusamy, a well-known editor at The Daily Maverick, a South African newspaper. “Everyone’s quiet and flipping through pages, and now and then you look up to see who is on what page. I went right to the end to look at the findings. When I saw them, I wanted to scream.”\n South Africans Vote as Zuma Seeks Second Term as President MAY 7, 2014 In South Africa, A.N.C. Is Counting on the Past MAY 5, 2014 Painting of Zuma Draws Attacks in South Africa MAY 22, 2012 Inside the Vigilante Fight Against Boko Haram NOV. 5, 2014 Madonsela’s office falls somewhere between a government watchdog and a public prosecutor. It is one of the so-­called Chapter Nine institutions that were established in the post-­apartheid 1996 Constitution to help safeguard South Africa’s fledgling democracy. Most of the reports the office releases concern low-­level government corruption; this one contained the results of Madonsela’s 18-month investigation into President Jacob Zuma.\nThe report found that three months after Zuma was first elected in May 2009, he used state funds to renovate his private residence, just south of the rural town Nkandla in the Zulu homeland of KwaZulu-­Natal. He claimed that he needed to improve his security system. A few months after work began in August 2009, The Mail and Guardian, another South African newspaper, reported that the upgrades included a helipad, a clinic and at least three new houses for the president’s personal employees — and that the total cost had swelled to more than $5 million. The government maintained that only security enhancements were being made to Zuma’s homestead at taxpayer expense; Zuma told Parliament that he had paid for the extra improvements himself. But by the end of 2012, several South African citizens and a former opposition leader had filed complaints with the office of the public protector, asking that Madonsela look into Zuma’s use of state money.\n New York Times Magazine Newsletter Sign up to get the best of the Magazine delivered to your inbox every week, including exclusive feature stories, photography, columns and more.\nAs the journalists’ allotted three hours with the documents came to an end, Madonsela entered the room. Everyone jumped up to push cameras and recorders in front of her, hungry for comment. Exceedingly self-­possessed, Madonsela, who is 52, has a deliberative air that projects both utter confidence and nervous shyness, depending on the moment. She explained how she came to find — through interviews with public-­works and police officials, contractors and Zuma himself, along with a review of “voluminous documents” — that the president misappropriated government funds and violated the state ethics code. Zuma, she said, did not stop his architect and other service providers from freely piling up costs and potentially diverting funds while finishing the project, which also included underground bunkers, a security fence, a cattle kraal, a swimming pool and an amphitheater. Ultimately, the renovations at Zuma’s compound cost taxpayers roughly $20 million.\n After taking questions, Madonsela announced the remedial actions her office would pursue. “I am requesting the president take steps, with the assistance of the National Treasury and the South African Police Service, to determine the reasonable cost of the measures implemented by D.P.W. [Department of Public Works] at his private residence that do not relate to security,” she said. The room tensed. She also wanted Zuma to pay the people of South Africa back the money.\nMadonsela was anxious. “I knew what I had done was just,” she said later. “It was a question of the way I had presented my decision. Was it persuasive enough?” The 2014 general election was less than two months away, and Madonsela feared that her investigation would be seen as politically motivated. Zuma’s party, the governing African National Congress, was already claiming as much. “I experienced crazy things with the security cluster trying to stop the investigation,” Madonsela told me. The police minister threatened to arrest her if she released the report, saying it would constitute a breach of Zuma’s security. Various A.N.C. government ministers held news conferences or gave interviews dismissing her past findings against them. Church leaders, who traditionally aligned themselves with the A.N.C., demanded that demons be cast out of her office over a separate investigation she was leading into the affairs of an executive at the state-­owned media company.\nMadonsela was appointed South Africa’s public protector by Zuma himself in 2009 and is used to controversy. Many of the thousands of cases her office handles each year are resolved through mediation, but about a fifth are “very difficult” cases, including the investigation she is now conducting into the possible diversion of funds meant for Nelson Mandela’s funeral. None, however, have been as divisive as her investigation of Zuma.\nAfter Madonsela released the Nkandla report, she was accused of acting as a covert agent for the Central Intelligence Agency; carrying out an agenda on behalf of the mostly white opposition Democratic Alliance party; acting as she if were God; being racist toward A.N.C. voters; and overreaching her office’s powers. The Congress of South African Students, an anti-­apartheid black student organization, said her nose was ugly (it later retracted the statement). Her staff tried to hide the hate-­spewing anonymous letters that arrived from around the country. She could ignore most of the vitriol, she said, except for the accusation that she was a C.I.A. agent, made by the deputy minister of defense, Kebby Maphatsoe. “I was sad that people would stoop that low,” she said, shaking her head. “It was the saddest moment of my career. That is the A.N.C. that I grew up loving.”\nThe A.N.C. holds a great deal of emotional sway over South Africans; it is the party of liberation and a powerful draw at the ballot box. The country still has no strong opposition party. The closest contender, the Democratic Alliance, won 22 percent of the vote during the 2014 election, compared with the A.N.C.’s 62 percent. “Sixty-­two percent is substantial,” says John Jeffery, the deputy justice minister. “And the issues of Nkandla were known at that point. The public protector’s report was already out. We’ve got to remember how the electorate voted and continues to vote.”\n Advertisement Because of their governing majority, many A.N.C. leaders have acted as though they are beyond scrutiny. Madonsela was calling them to account. “The work here has exposed fault lines in our democracy,” she said. “It’s got people talking about what kind of democracy we have — and what kind of democracy we deserve.”\nPhoto President Jacob Zuma's private compound near Nkandla, where construction drew scrutiny from the public protector. Credit Associated Press The A.N.C. has been more than just a political party since leading South Africa out of apartheid in 1991, as part of a tripartite alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party. It became a democratic beacon on the continent: After more than a century of institutional racism, South Africa had a new liberal constitution, new democratic institutions and new economic potential. Nelson Mandela, the country’s first post-­apartheid president, was a global icon. But in recent years, the A.N.C. has experienced increasing turmoil. Endless corruption scandals, mishandling of the H.I.V. and AIDS crisis and cronyism have weakened the party and caused some South Africans to wonder whether it is time for another party to try governing. Defenders contend that criticism of successive A.N.C. governments is rooted in bigotry, that white holders of private wealth — in mining, farming and the media — tend to paint the public sector, which is dominated by blacks, as hopelessly corrupt and inefficient.\nThe president is at the heart of this tension. Zuma devoted his life to the fight for freedom, helping to lead A.N.C. branches and committees and its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, and was imprisoned for 10 years for his activities. When the A.N.C. took power, Mandela appointed him to a provincial post. He has since been the subject of several corruption investigations, eluding rape, racketeering, money-­laundering and fraud charges. He was dismissed as deputy president by Thabo Mbeki, South Africa’s second post-­apartheid president, after his financial adviser was convicted in 2005 of procuring a bribe from a French arms manufacturer.\nZuma has managed to retain support among the electorate by portraying himself as a savior of the rural poor and their traditions. It is a platform that resonates with black voters, who remain disproportionately poor. Most of the country’s fertile land is still owned by a few thousand white commercial farmers, while tens of thousands of black farmers crowd on near-­barren land. Some of this is because the apartheid government started to privatize many of the state’s assets — roads, rail and the national airline — in the years before it fell, weakening federal power before blacks took over. Then, as now, cheap black labor provided the engine of these industries, especially the immensely profitable mineral-­extraction sector.\nThe A.N.C. has made some tangible changes. It has built millions of houses, increased access to electricity and running water and created an expansive social-­welfare program. Average incomes have grown over the past two decades. “The lives of the bottom 20 percent have changed since apartheid,” says Jonny Steinberg, a South African professor in the African studies department at Oxford who has written about the country’s transition to democracy. “And all of these changes have been delivered directly by the state.”\n Nevertheless, Zuma’s administration has failed to create enough jobs, effectively redistribute land that was illegally taken from blacks or invest in infrastructure like new power plants. The country is suffering through rolling blackouts as demand outstrips supply. Economic growth has slowed to less than 5 percent, and the rand is falling. Worst of all, unemployment is more than 25 percent, and youth unemployment is at 50 percent. On the local level, corruption is even more widespread than it is nationally. State funds regularly disappear into politicians’ pockets, and residents are forced to stage protests for access to running water, electricity and better schools and clinics. To be heard, protesters often resort to burning down schools, government buildings and whatever else they can seize.\n“Poor people are talking about the government in a sharp, critical way for the first time,” Steinberg says, “connecting unemployment and electricity blackouts to bad governance.” That discontent has increased the appeal of opposition leaders like the fiery Julius Malema, once the president of the A.N.C. Youth League and now the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters party, whose members, dressed in red worker overalls and maid outfits, denounce corruption in the A.N.C.\nZwelinzima Vavi, a former general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, says the “trappings of power” have poisoned the government. “South African democracy is under threat from a gang of ‘tenderpreneurs’ who seek to build instant wealth using the power they have and the control they hold over the state,” Vavi says, referring to officials who enrich themselves through corrupt tenders, or contracts. “These will be people who have grown very powerful because of the patronage networks they have set up. If we can’t stop this, it seems we will be marching slowly but surely toward a building of a kleptocracy.” (The Zuma administration did not respond to repeated requests for comment on these allegations, but said it has “come out hard on any acts of corruption, particularly within the Public Service.”)\nPhoto President Jacob Zuma. Credit Associated Press The year before Madonsela took office, becoming the third public protector in the nation’s history and the first woman to hold the post, the office handled just over 19,000 cases. Five years later, that number had doubled. “We’ve had other public protectors before her, and all of them were pretty soft with government,” Justice Malala, a political analyst in Johannesburg, told me. “She comes along and starts taking on power and saying, ‘This just isn’t right.’ The Zuma case actually gave the office prominence and stature in the popular mind. It’s restored the idea that there’s someone fighting for the little man and woman in a village somewhere.”\nBut the reception of the Nkandla report wasn’t what Madonsela expected. “The behavior of some people last year was strange,” she said later, still in disbelief. Many of her comrades abandoned her. They continued to argue that Zuma made only essential security upgrades. During the 1990s, when the rivalry between the A.N.C. and the Inkatha Freedom Party over resources, land and political power turned violent, Zuma’s compound was invaded many times. Just days before the 2014 election, Zuma revealed that during one such breach, one of his wives had been raped. What else was the president to do?\n Still, South Africans had complained to Madonsela about the president’s extravagances, and it was her duty to look into them. The Constitution allows her to “take appropriate remedial action” — usually directives that Parliament, the presidency or the courts are expected, though not required, to follow. That was what happened when Madonsela investigated Sicelo Shiceka, a former cooperative governance and traditional affairs minister, for the excessive use of state funds for travel, and then Hlaudi Motsoeneng, the chief operating officer of the South African Broadcasting Corporation, for falsified educational credentials and unjustified salary increases. Zuma fired Shiceka, and a court suspended Motsoeneng.\nWhen Madonsela wrote to Zuma last August asking him to act on her recommendations, he declared that Parliament would ultimately decide his fate. He did not address Madonsela’s question about how taxpayer money had been apportioned, nor did he explain why he previously claimed that he had paid for the upgrades himself. Instead, he ordered his police minister, Nkosinathi Nhleko, to determine if any money needed to be paid back. Nhleko issued his own report at the end of May, absolving Zuma. He claimed that the swimming pool was an essential “fire pool,” that the cattle kraal was an area of important cultural and spiritual value that also aided in security and that the amphitheater was an assembly area in case of emergency.\nIn August 2014, five months after Madonsela’s report was released, Parliament created a committee to consider the charges but did not call any witnesses or interview the president. Opposition members resigned from the committee in protest, which left it with a membership drawn entirely from the A.N.C. The committee decided that Zuma did not benefit from the upgrades to his private home and blamed public-­works officials for the excessive spending. Zuma, it said, was simply unaware of the misuse of funds.\nToday, many within the A.N.C. believe that the public protector’s report was politically motivated. Khaya Xaba, a spokesman for the Young Communist League, a wing of the South African Communist Party, sees Madonsela as inherently biased. “We feel that she’s compromised, we feel that she’s now serving the agenda of the liberals,” he told me, referring to the Democratic Alliance, which, along with the other opposition parties, mostly supports Madonsela’s scrutiny of government officials. (She spoke at a Democratic Alliance women’s event in 2012 but otherwise has no association with the party.) Xaba, who is young and heavyset with tattoos covering his arms, was disappointed by the way Madonsela released the Nkandla report to the news media. “Was she trying to be some rock star?” he asked. “Or some Jesus or some messiah? We believe she’s been targeting the president.” Jeffery, the deputy justice minister, agrees. “She’s not a judicial or quasi-­judicial body,” he says, adding that her report “gets put into the public domain for people then to argue whether she’s right or whether she’s not right.” Jeffery believed that Madonsela wanted to enforce her own recommendations, which he said is illegal under the Constitution. “Who guards against the public protector?” he asked.\n Zuma apparently intends to. His maneuvering around Madonsela’s report has thrown the power of her office into question. But South Africans have since rallied around her. “She’s doing something that is not easy to do,” said Refilwe Mokhasipe, a young woman in Johannesburg. “She’s brave. We need people like her around, to bring order to the country. I love my president, but let him do the right thing for once. It’s unfortunate that she has to be crucified for doing the right thing.” There are several Facebook pages devoted to her. Bongi Bangeni, a senior lecturer at the University of Cape Town, says: “There hasn’t been someone whom young black women can look up to. I think Thuli offers that hope.” She went on: “Everyone is singing her praises, from the young to the old, across the color boundary, black, white. Everyone is saying in public, ‘Good job, well done.’ That shows as a nation we’re tired, we’re fed up.”\nPhoto Members of the Economic Freedom Fighters opposition party demonstrating before Zuma’s State of the Nation address in February. Credit Associated Press “I’m not some African warrior princess,” Madonsela told me in February while sitting in her office in Pretoria, a capital city of midrise government buildings and bland housing developments. She is simultaneously steely and gentle-­mannered. Dressed that day in a green blouse and a dark blazer, she exuded a glamorous calm. But when Parliament interrogates her about why she chooses to pursue certain cases or complains that she demands that her decisions be enforced, she sometimes visibly bristles, asserting that it is not her duty to answer to lawmakers or anyone else. She sees the role of the public protector as above the petty politics of governance.\nMadonsela rises early, usually before dawn, to review reports of the cases her teams are handling and then goes for a walk to clear her head. When she returns home, she meditates and prays and then checks email and Twitter. She has more than 166,000 followers on Twitter, where she asks about the state of the country and shares motivational thoughts (“I often wonder what we would lose if we disagreed without name-­calling, if we simply improved the quality of our arguments. #TheWorldIYearnFor”). They tweet back their admiration or frustration or, as one man did, offer unsolicited advice on her hairstyle (“I see the weave is gone . . . Hallelujah . . . LOL”).\nBorn in Johannesburg, a sprawling metropolis of sleek highways woven around high-­walled homes, cramped shantytowns and shimmering shopping malls, Madonsela grew up as one of five siblings in the township of Soweto. Her mother was a maid and her father an electrician who later started a communal taxi business. Madonsela’s parents sent her to neighboring Swaziland so she could receive an education outside apartheid-­era black schools. “In the township, the role models we had were teachers and nurses,” she recalled. Her father wanted her to be a nurse, but she chose law, and he refused to pay for her studies. A rigorous student, she persisted and secured a scholarship. (Madonsela had a weakness for comic books in her earlier years, though. She would hide them inside her textbooks in class when she grew bored.)\n While an undergraduate, she started working with the black trade-­union movement. She wanted to do what she could to help black workers organize in white-run industries. The police often went to the family home in Soweto looking for her and her brother Musa, an anti-­apartheid activist. After the ban on the A.N.C. was lifted and the party was voted into power, Madonsela provided the A.N.C. with legal advice. She was also enlisted as a technical consultant when the country’s post-­apartheid Constitution was being finalized, working on drafting the Bill of Rights and on reconciling the right to equality with cultural, religious and customary rights. “It was once-­in-­a-­lifetime,” she said of the experience. “It was quite exciting.”\nWhen Zuma appointed Madonsela public protector in 2009, she was working as a lawyer with the South African Law Reform Commission, an independent organization that works with Parliament and local legislatures on legal issues. The search for a new public protector is designed to include people outside the government. Parliament solicits nominations from the public, and then a parliamentary committee interviews a shortlist of candidates and recommends one person to the president. For Madonsela, the job felt like an extension of her lifelong fight for human rights.\n“I was particularly concerned about the ordinary administrative wrongs against ordinary people,” she told me. “I wanted to position the office so that any gogo dlamini , any old lady, in the middle of nowhere in South Africa knows where to go when they feel they’ve been wronged by the state.” Madonsela pursued high-­profile cases like “Guptagate,” in which a wealthy Indian family close to Zuma was allowed to land a private plane carrying wedding guests at a military base, as well as smaller injustices. She corrected a shortage of workbooks at an Eastern Cape school and helped several whistle-­blowers receive back wages and reclaim their jobs. “You feel a real sense of gratitude, honestly,” she said, “if somebody was fired wrongly, and for the last five years they’ve had no income, they have lost their house and they did not know where to go, and they finally ended up here, and we got them their jobs back.”\nHer willingness to take on big cases has sometimes put her at personal risk. In 2011, she investigated Bheki Cele, the national police commissioner at the time, over inflated contracts for properties the police service was leasing. “I thought that maybe she should resign, because it was getting not only personal but bordering along the lines of danger,” says her brother Musa, who runs construction and consulting businesses in Soweto. He heard some young men saying that his sister was troublesome and that they needed to get rid of her. (Zuma eventually fired Cele for unjustly awarding the contracts.)\nContinue Madonsela believes that her sex has also made her work more difficult. Parliament condemned her for her salary, saying it was too high, even though her male predecessor made the same amount. “I have felt the way some of the people talk down to me,” she told me in February. “It’s race, it’s gender, it’s age. There’s internalized racism by black people themselves, who would feel, ‘I can take an order from a white person, I can take orders from a male, but really I’m not used to taking orders from a black woman.’ It’s like watching some of the American slave movies, where the house slave determines that it is his duty to protect the master and won’t even ask what needs to be done. They will be even more ruthless than the master himself in trying to gain favor with the master. Some of the people really have gone there.” She stopped, faltering. “I don’t think the president authorized people to go around calling me a spy.”\n To Madonsela’s shock, the country’s State Security Agency said in March that it is conducting an investigation into the claims that she is a C.I.A. agent. When she visited Parliament in late April to ask for an expanded budget — she said her office had settled 21,170 of 29,303 recent cases but required more staff members — the A.N.C. chairman of a parliamentary justice committee, Mathole Motshekga, said she had “become a law unto herself” and wasted taxpayer money. Later the committee told her that she must now report to it four times a year, as opposed to the usual two required of the other Chapter Nine offices.\nAll of this, says Malala, the political analyst in Johannesburg, reflects how difficult it is to change the country’s political culture. “How often in the life of a nation do people go for the president of the country on the basis that he spent $20 million on himself?” he says. “Madonsela is doing the best with the resources she’s got. But as long as she’s going after the big fish, there will be attempts to cut her down.”\nOne evening in Cape Town this February, when it was still light and warm, residents looked up at the sky in annoyance as military helicopters hovered over the compact city between the misty mountains and the sea, announcing Zuma’s arrival at the Houses of Parliament for the annual State of the Nation address. A red carpet, photographers and police officers on horseback greeted attendees in formal attire, including Madonsela, who wore a pink-­and-­red gown. After the speech, there was to be a gala cocktail party and dinner at a cost of almost $400,000 to taxpayers. But most of the opposition politicians wouldn’t make it to the event. As soon as Zuma began his address, he was interrupted by an Economic Freedom Fighters member wanting to know how he would pay back the money for his home renovations — by bank transfer or perhaps by another method? The Assembly speaker ordered the E.F.F. parliamentarians to leave. When they refused, a chaotic brawl broke out between the E.F.F. members, dressed as usual in workers’ and maids’ outfits, and a security team that swept into the room. The security officers dragged the lawmakers through the door. A.N.C. members cheered, and Zuma laughed. The Democratic Alliance walked out in protest.\nI found Madonsela in the public protector’s office in downtown Cape Town the next afternoon. With her manicured nails and delicate jewelry, she looked as if she had just come from the previous night’s event. “I couldn’t sleep,” she said. “There was a time when I felt like crying, but I never had tears.” She spoke slowly, turning over her words. “There was a sense of confusion. I had deep sadness.” The fighting was painful to watch, but she thought it had woken people up. “Yesterday became a catalyst,” she said. A debate was raging over whether the government unconstitutionally allowed police officers into Parliament, but she thought that was beside the point. The situation had to get worse so everyone would understand that after the Nkandla report, things couldn’t just go back to the way they were until the president owned up to wrongdoing. “Somebody had to raise the accountability question,” she said. She just wished the confrontation wasn’t on a day when the world was watching and would think that South Africa had become a banana republic.\nAt the end of May, Madonsela publicly reconsidered her approach to the president. She said that if she were to do it again, she would have used stronger language in her judgment. She now says that Zuma benefited improperly and unlawfully, not just unduly, from the security upgrades; it’s a distinction that suggests criminality. It took her more than a year to reach this new position, a risky one, after enduring personal and professional attacks that have left her office crippled. She has 160 corruption cases that have been outstanding for more than a year and doesn’t have the resources to hire even contract investigators to tackle the backlog.\nThe case against Zuma drags on. The Special Investigating Unit is now suing his architect for damages, putting the exorbitant expenses on him. Madonsela still calls herself an optimist, a believer in the country’s democratic project, despite the entrenched resistance to her work. She plans to write another letter to Zuma, she said, imploring him to heed her report. It’s unclear, though, if anyone will be listening.",

      "text": "JUNE 15, 2015 An Associated Press team on the Turkish side of the Akcakale border crossing said a large black and white Islamic State group flag was taken down from a pole in Tal Abyad and replaced with a yellow, triangular YPG flag Tuesday. The border was calm, in sharp contrast to previous days when thousands of Syrians poured into the border crossing, some punching a hole in the fence to break into Turkey. On Tuesday, a few civilians were seen walking around, along with some people on the Turkish side apparently waiting to go back into Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed Tuesday that the YPG seized the town with the Free Syrian Army. The takeover of Tal Abyad marks the biggest setback yet to the Islamic State group, which lost a key supply line for its nearby self-proclaimed capital in Raqqa. It deprives the group of a direct route for bringing in foreign militants and supplies, and links the Kurds' two fronts, putting even more pressure on Raqqa. The U.S. provided crucial air cover for the Kurds in their advance, launching concentrated airstrikes that targeted the militants inside and along supply routes. The Islamic State defeat in Tal Abyad is a stunning reversal of fortunes for the group, which only last month captured the provincial capital of Ramadi in Iraq's Anbar province and the historic town of Palmyra in central Syria. The Islamic State group still holds about a third of Iraq and Syria, including Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul. Extremist fighters continue to battle Iraqi security forces and Shiite militiamen for territory north and east of the capital, Baghdad. On Tuesday, Iraqi officials said that families began returning to Tikrit two and a half months after security forces backed by Shiite militias drove the Islamic State group out of the Sunni city. Gov. Raed al-Jabouri of Salahuddin province told the AP in a phone interview that around 200 families, who spent the past months either in makeshift tent camps or half-built and abandoned buildings outside the city, had returned the day before. Al-Jabouri said more than 1,000 families are expected to return Thursday. \nAdvertisement ",

      "title": "Morning Agenda: Split Decision for Greenberg in A.I.G. Lawsuit - NYTimes.com",
      "text": "SPLIT DECISION FOR GREENBERG IN A.I.G. LAWSUIT | On Monday, Judge Thomas C. Wheeler of the United States Court of Federal Claims sided with Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group, ruling that the Federal Reserve illegally took over A.I.G. as part of its $185 billion bailout of the troubled company in 2008, Aaron M. Kessler writes in DealBook . It wasn’t a complete victory for Mr. Greenberg , who is also one of the largest shareholders of A.I.G. – he wasn’t awarded any portion of the $40 billion in damages he was seeking because the judge also sided with the government in its argument that the bailout had saved A.I.G. from the bankruptcy.\nLegal analysts were divided on which side could claim victory, but the decision could have “far-reaching consequences should another financial crisis occur — and if history is any guide, one will,” Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column . “Legal experts say that the ruling, coupled with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law enacted after the crisis, makes it unlikely the government would ever rescue a failing institution , even if an intervention was warranted.”\nDennis Kelleher, president and chief executive of Better Markets, an advocacy group for financial reform, called the ruling perplexing . “The court bizarrely expressed repeated sympathy for A.I.G. while failing to properly weigh the economic wreckage suffered by the American people,” Mr. Kelleher said in an email. Many online readers of Mr. Sorkin’s column expressed similar sentiments, with one commenter, V of Los Angeles, saying, “What an absurd ruling, Judge Wheeler. The taxpayers were overly generous because Maurice Greenberg, and the rest of these bankers who brought us to the edge of a fiscal cliff in 2008 with unethical, criminal behavior didn’t go to jail.”\nThe judge’s split decision is likely to lead one or both sides to appeal, Mr. Kessler writes. Todd Bault, an analyst with Citigroup, said in a research note on Monday that while Mr. Greenberg and the A.I.G. shareholders were “awarded a ‘moral’ win, the case that no damage was inflicted seems plausible, and thus an appeal could be difficult to win .”\nGOLDMAN SACHS TO OFFER CONSUMERS ONLINE LOANS | Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street banker of the wealthy and privileged, is aiming to expand its customer base through a new business unit that will offer consumer loans of a few thousand dollars through a website or app, Michael Corkery and Nathaniel Popper write in DealBook . In doing so, Goldman will join the ranks of online lending start-ups that threaten to shake up the $840 billion consumer loan business . Goldman hopes that the new unit will be ready to make its first loans next year, according to people briefed on its plans, Mr. Corkery and Mr. Popper write.\nMr. Corkery and Mr. Popper point out that Goldman faces a number of risks in starting this new business. It has little experience in dealing with ordinary borrowers with limited financial cushions, and if Goldman adopts harsh tactics to recover its money, it would revive accusations that the Wall Street bank earns profits at the expense of ordinary people. Also, even if Goldman can offer lower rates, consumers may stay with their Main Street banks out of habit . “The biggest thing the banks have in their favor is inertia,” said Nick Clements, co-founder of MagnifyMoney, a website that helps borrowers compare credit card and loan offers.\nCVS’ HEALTHY APPETITE FOR EXPANSION | With its $1.9 billion acquisition of Target’s pharmacy and clinic businesses, CVS Health is making it clear that its appetite for expansion shows no signs of abating, Katie Thomas, Chad Bray and Hiroko Tabuchi write in DealBook . If the deal is completed, CVS would acquire more than 1,600 pharmacies from Target in 47 states and operate them under the CVS name in Target stores. “CVS Health is building a business that has a lot of interlocking synergies in many different parts of the health care system,” said Adam J. Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, a management advisory and business research company based in Philadelphia. “The Target deal is one more step in their goal of becoming the most significant company in the drug distribution and reimbursement system .”\nMr. Fein said the deal would allow CVS to expand into areas of the country, like the Pacific Northwest, where its presence is weak. Employers in those regions may be more likely to choose CVS/caremark , the company’s pharmacy benefits business, to manage their drug benefits if their employees could conveniently pick up their medications at a store nearby. For Target, the deal would give it cash to offset losses from its short-lived foray into Canada , said Craig Johnson, president of the New Canaan, Conn.-based retail consulting firm Customer Growth Partners. Also, Target can now strengthen its focus on its food business , where it is making a big push into natural and organic produce to take on the likes of Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe’s, and its wellness, style and baby and children’s products .\nON THE AGENDA | The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting begins today. Data on housing starts for May is out at 8:30 a.m. Adobe Systems is among the companies reporting earnings. Dick Costolo , Twitter’s chief executive, and Marissa Mayer , Yahoo’s chief executive, are among the scheduled speakers at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in San Francisco.\n2 GIANT HEALTH INSURERS SAID TO COURT SMALLER RIVALS | Trying to cut costs as they cope with the Affordable Care Act, UnitedHealth Group and Anthem, the two biggest American health insurance companies by revenue, are each courting smaller rivals, The Wall Street Journal reports , citing people familiar with the matter. UnitedHealth made a preliminary takeover offer to Aetna , which has a market value of about $42 billion, in the last few days, people familiar with the matter told the newspaper.\nMeanwhile, Anthem and Cigna have been in discussions about a deal for months, though Cigna has rejected Anthem’s offers, The Journal reports. Within the last 10 days, Anthem has made two takeover bids for Cigna , the latest at about $175 a share, people familiar with the matter told the newspaper.\nMergers & Acquisitions » G.E.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story Most of the action in venture capital now is in so-called growth rounds, with billions of dollars flowing into established technology superstars like Uber and Pinterest.\nBut Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of Silicon Valley’s best-known investment firms, is trying a different approach: focusing on early-stage seed rounds — and offering founders unusual terms.\nThe firm announced on Tuesday a new $4 million fund, called the Edge Fund, that will essentially lend entrepreneurs up to $250,000. The Edge Fund will also supply founders with an array of services, including technical programming help, recruiting and operational expertise.\nIn many ways, Kleiner Perkins is treading well-worn ground. Many of its competitors have long provided seed capital, which is often the first outside money that start-ups raise. And some other firms, like Andreessen Horowitz, have also provided their portfolio companies with additional services.\nBut the Edge Fund is pitching itself as a particularly friendly way for founders to raise capital while allowing Kleiner Perkins to make new, smaller types of investments that its previous funds were not set up to make.\nIn an interview, Anjney Midha, a partner at Kleiner Perkins and a founding partner of the Edge Fund, said that the traditional venture capital structure did not permit this kind of approach. In particular, founders don’t get as much help as they need.\n“I can’t think of any other group in venture capital doing this,” he said.\nThe fund will give entrepreneurs a final decision on investing within 72 hours of an initial meeting.\nPerhaps the most unusual feature of the new initiative is that it will not take standard common shares in the companies it backs. Instead, it will offer uncapped convertible notes, more or less debt that can be converted into common shares.\nThose loans will not assign a valuation to a start-up, putting less pressure on founders when it comes time for their next fund-raising round, Mr. Midha said. Instead, in that next capital-raising effort, the companies can either choose to repay the loan or redeem the convertible notes into stock at the valuation that new investors assigned the company.\nThat avoids diluting the founders and other employees because they don’t necessarily have to give up any equity.\nThe firm is focusing on six main industries in which to back start-ups, including virtual reality, drones and digital health.\nThe idea for Edge Fund arose from conversations between Mr. Midha, who joined Kleiner Perkins about a year and a half ago, and Mike Abbott, a partner whose investments at the firm include Snapchat and Codecademy. The two bonded over coding, particularly over an internal project that Mr. Midha had been working on, and mused to each other about how that was what the two should be focusing on.\nAt the same time, given the size of Kleiner Perkins’ existing funds, the firm could not write checks small enough to make seed-size investments.\nWhat they came up with, in Mr. Midha’s words, was “full-stack venture capital” that offers start-ups a wider range of resources than they might have on their own.\nAt the moment, Edge Fund’s team includes Mr. Midha, who previously worked on Kleiner Perkins’s investments in the likes of Magic Leap, the augmented reality company; Ruby Lee, who previously worked at Google; and Roneil Rumburg, the founder of Backslash, a Bitcoin payments start-up.\nWhat the Edge Fund isn’t, according to Kleiner Perkins, is a direct competitor to syndicates of individual angel investors like AngelList or various crowdfunding efforts.\nMr. Midha professed admiration for AngelList, but added, “At some point, as a founder, you need more than a check.”\nSo far, the initiative has made four investments, though Mr. Midha declined to identify them.\nUnusually, Mr. Midha contended that turning a profit was not necessarily the biggest aim of the Edge Fund. Instead, he said, it was promoting a more robust ecosystem within those six industries, and one in which Kleiner Perkins will hopefully have a healthy piece.\n“if I make one times our money, it’s a success,” he said.\nLoading...

      "text": "Wall St. Edges Higher in Early Trading By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Continue reading the main story United States markets opened slightly higher on Tuesday, clawing back some of the ground they lost the day before. Global stock markets sagged as jitters mounted over whether Greece and its creditors could reach a bailout agreement that will keep the country from defaulting on its debts. KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.16 percent. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.04 percent. HEALTH MERGER TALK Shares of Aetna rose 3 percent after The Wall Street Journal reported that UnitedHealth Group approached the rival health insurer about a deal. EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX fell 0.5 percent and in France, the CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent. The FTSE 100 was down 0.4 percent in Britain. GREECE WORRIES Global markets are getting shaken by Greece after weekend negotiations between the country and its creditors failed to get the struggling nation closer to a bailout deal. Greek leaders want the final 7.2 billion euros ($8.2 billion) of their bailout program that they need to pay debts at the end of June. Without the loans, Greece is likely to default on its debts this summer, something that could push it out of the euro, with uncertain consequences for Europe and the global economy. THE QUOTE “The worry lies in the possibility that the credibility of the E.U. may have suffered substantially, should Greece be allowed to go into cardiac arrest,” Bernard Aw, a market strategist at IG in Singapore, said in a commentary. The issue could also spread to other “vulnerable E.U. countries such as Spain and Portugal to consider whether staying in E.U. is right for them,” he said. FED POLICY Markets will monitor the Federal Reserve’s two-day June policy meeting, which is to begin later Tuesday. The big question is what clues the Fed will give about when it will start raising interest rates. ASIA’S DAY The Nikkei 225 ended down 0.6 percent in Japan, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell 1.1 percent. The Kospi lost 0.7 percent in South Korea. Other Asian benchmarks, including those in Taiwan and Singapore, were also lower. CURRENCIES AND BONDS The dollar was down slightly, at 123.46 yen from 123.52 yen the previous day. The euro was down to $1.1229 from $1.1247. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent. ENERGY Benchmark United States crude oil recouped earlier losses, adding 45 cents to $59.97 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract hit a high for the year on Wednesday. Loading...

      "text": "Is the U.S. Open Ready for the Fox Era? JUNE 16, 2015 Supported By Photo Technicians adjust a video camera slider rail at Chambers Bay golf course. Fox has promised innovative coverage at the United States Open. Credit Ted S. Warren/Associated Press \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Fox Sports is going to ruin the United States Open golf tournament. No, it’s going to reinvigorate it. Fox will turn the major into a laboratory for its newfangled gadgets. No, Fox will give viewers a better view of the tournament and the Chambers Bay course in Washington State. Over the past 20 years, the debate over what Fox will or won’t do — with its talent and technology — has accompanied its entries into the N.F.L., Major League Baseball and the N.H.L. O.K., some hockey traditionalists’ worst fears were fulfilled when Fox deployed the glowing puck, with its accompanying comet tail. I’ve seen worse innovations. So here comes Fox with its drones, its immersive graphics, its ball tracers, its virtual reality and its microphones at the bottom of each of the 18 holes. (No robots so far.) See More » They might all turn out fine — or distract us. They might rile older fans but get new ones. All the lessons Fox learned from televising baseball, football, hockey and Nascar might make golf a lot more fun to watch. Or they might ruin it. As one might expect, Mark Loomis, the coordinator producer for Fox’s United States Open coverage, said last week that all the new technology was in service to covering the tournament. “We’re are going to try and do a lot of things there to make the viewer feel like they are playing the golf course right in front of them,” he said during a conference call. “We’re trying to get some dimensions to the greens, increase the audio from the course, and give you a better look of what the shot looks like from the golfer’s view.” He added: “The technology is part of the experience. It’s not the experience.” My guess: Fox will probably overuse the technology at the start — if only to test its limits — then scale it back as early as the final round on Sunday. Fox’s acquisition of Open rights was a bit of a shock. NBC wanted to retain them and thought they had. So did ESPN. According to a Golf Digest article , the presentation by NBC officials to the United States Golf Association in June 2013, was a “home run,” including an appearance on the network’s behalf by Arnold Palmer. NBC and ESPN were planning to double what they were paying. But by August, that equation had changed. The U.S.G.A. saw even bigger money coming from Fox and a promise of innovation. Randy Freer, then the co-president of Fox Sports, sounded a bit snarky as he celebrated Fox’s first golf deal, saying, “We think the U.S. Open can once again be the pre-eminent golf championship in the world” — implying that its status had diminished during NBC’s tenure. Johnny Miller, NBC’s lead golf analyst, told The Associated Press at the time: “I guess the money was more important than the performance. No way they can step in and do the job we were doing. It’s impossible. There’s just no way.” But that was nearly two years ago. Fox set about building its golf infrastructure, and last week, NBC made a 12-year deal to carry the British Open, starting in 2017, replacing ESPN. \nAdvertisement",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story AQAP's master bomb-maker, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, is also believed to still be alive. He is thought to have designed the bombs used in the cargo planes plot and in the 2009 plane-bombing plot, in which the bomber hid explosives in his underwear but botched the detonation. Al-Asiri also designed the explosives used by his own younger brother, who blew himself up in a failed 2009 attempt to assassinate Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, then head of Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism agency. Mohammed is now the crown prince. Al-Shihri is a Saudi national. Al-Wahishi's death is a major loss for al-Qaida as it struggles to compete with the Islamic State, a breakaway group that has seized vast swaths of Syria and Iraq and spawned its own affiliates elsewhere in the region. The Islamic State group has also gained loyalists in Yemen in competition with al-Qaida. Both groups are dedicated to bringing about Islamic rule by force, but al-Qaida does not recognize the IS group's self-styled caliphate and has maintained that the priority should be to wage jihad against America in order to drive it out of the Middle East. Al-Qaida has been able to make major gains in Yemen the past months as the country is torn by war between Shiite rebels known as Houthis who have taken over much of the country and their opponents, a mix of local militias, southern separatists, Sunni tribesmen and backers of the president, Abed Rabbo Hadi Mansour, who was driven abroad by the fighting. Al-Qaida's militants have allied with some of the anti-Houthi forces in fighting the rebels. Batarfi said his group is fighting rebels and allied forces in 11 fronts. The capture of Mukalla was the group's biggest victory. It freed a number of prisoners, including Batrafi. It then struck a power-sharing deal with local tribesmen. But Mukalla has proved something of a death trap. Besides al-Wahishi, U.S. drone strikes in and around the city have killed the group's top military commander Nasr al-Ansi, its most senior religious ideologue Ibrahim al-Rubaish, and key operatives Mamoun Hatem and Khalwan al-Sanaani. In recent years, U.S. strikes have also killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-Yemeni militant preacher who was a major recruiter for the group, and Saeed al-Shihri, an ex-Guantanamo detainee from Saudi Arabia who was al-Wahishi's deputy at the time. The intensity of US drone strikes comes despite the withdrawal earlier this year of U.S. counterterrorism personnel from the al-Annad air base in southern Yemen in addition to the closure of US embassy in the capital because of the country's fighting. The Special Forces commandos at the base had played a key role in drone strikes and there had been major concerns that the withdrawal would undermine the fight against al-Qaida. Al-Wahishi was known as bin Laden's \"black box,\" keeping the al-Qaida leader's secrets. It was not clear how much involvement al-Wahishi had in the 9/11 attacks in the United States. During the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, al-Wahishi fought alongside bin Laden at Tora Bora before the al-Qaida leader slipped across the border into Pakistan. Al-Wahishi fled to Iran, where he was detained and deported to Yemen in 2003. He was among 23 al-Qaida militants who broke out of a detention facility in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in February 2006. Three years later, al-Wahishi announced the creation of AQAP, which gathered together Yemeni and Saudi militants following a sweeping crackdown on the extremist group by Riyadh. According to the U.S. government's \"Wanted to Justice\" program, al-Wahishi, \"is responsible for approving targets, recruiting new members, allocating resources to training and attack planning, and tasking others to carry out attacks.\" Loading...",

      "text": " BEIJING — China announced on Tuesday that it would soon halt island-building projects around some reefs and shoals in disputed waters of the South China Sea but that it would continue constructing military and civilian facilities on those outcroppings.\nThe announcement may have been intended to ease tensions with the United States, which has strongly criticized the building of the islands and has sent surveillance flights close to the sites, to the chagrin of the Chinese military. The construction of facilities, though, would further establish the sites as islands that China could claim as its territory.\nIn the announcement on the website of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, a spokesman, said that “relevant departments” in China had decided to go forward as planned with completing land reclamation work on some reefs and islands in the Spratly archipelago in the “coming days.”\nHe added that the sites in the Spratlys, which the Chinese call the Nansha Islands, would be used for “military defense needs” as well as “civilian demands,” including maritime search and rescue efforts, disaster prevention and mitigation, scientific research, meteorological observation, navigational safety measures and fishery services.\n“After the land reclamation, we will start the building of facilities to meet relevant functional requirements,” Mr. Lu said.\nHe also reiterated earlier remarks defending the building of islands, saying that it fell “within the scope of China’s sovereignty,” was not targeting any other country and would not affect freedom of navigation or overflights allowed by international law.\nMr. Lu used the word garrison to describe some of the islands. In April, another Foreign Ministry representative used the same term and said military defense would be one of the uses of the sites.\nIn recent months, American officials have said that China’s land reclamation at seven sites in the region far outpaces similar efforts by other nations. The United States says China has built 2,000 acres of land around reefs and shoals over the last 18 months. American officials and leaders of Southeast Asian nations began criticizing the moves in early 2014, but that has done little to deter China, which foreign officials say has in fact been accelerating construction.\nChina, Taiwan and several Southeast Asian nations make territorial claims to the South China Sea. The United States has said it does not take sides in the sovereignty disputes, but it insists that all nations must refrain from interfering with freedom of navigation and from raising tensions.\nVietnam and the Philippines have built on pieces of land, but that has largely consisted of putting up buildings rather than land reclamation. Much of it also took place before 2002, when China and several other claimants to territory signed a nonbinding agreement in which each vowed not to act provocatively.\nShi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said on Tuesday that China’s announcement “could greatly reduce its strategic conflicts with the United States, at least at this stage.” He added that it could also “generate an amicable atmosphere” before Xi Jinping, the Chinese president and head of the Communist Party, visits the United States in September .\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n But Mr. Shi said the announcement did not necessarily mean that China was permanently ending land reclamation efforts and that in any case the United States would remain unhappy with China’s behavior in the South China Sea.\n“Despite the fact that China has suspended building on the islands and reefs, the U.S. still sees China’s actions as trying to establish a new status quo, which the U.S. does not intend to accept,” he said.\nIn late May, the United States military sent a P8-A Poseidon surveillance plane over Fiery Cross Reef, one of the sites of the land reclamation. The Chinese Navy warned the plane eight times to turn back as it approached the reef. A news crew from CNN on the plane recorded the exchange.\nThen on May 30, the United States defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, said at a regional security forum in Singapore that all nations should halt island-building in the South China Sea, but he singled out China. A senior Chinese colonel, Zhao Xiaozhuo , a researcher at the Chinese Army’s Academy of Military Science, publicly rebutted Mr. Carter on major points and said that if anything, “the region has been peaceful and stable just because of China’s great restraint.”\nSong Guoyou, a professor at the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said in an interview on Tuesday that “China has accelerated its reclamation in the South China Sea the last couple of years because the new Chinese leader is much more willing and resolute in safeguarding China’s sovereignty.”\nProfessor Song continued, “China’s reclamation and patrols are based on its own strategic judgment and needs, and it will not budge to U.S. pressure.”\nAmerican officials have also said they are concerned that China will try to declare an air defense identification zone over a portion of the South China Sea, as it did in 2013 over part of the disputed East China Sea. At the Singapore forum, Adm. Sun Jianguo, deputy chief of staff of the People’s Liberation Army, said that China could choose to do that based on an assessment of aerial threats and the maritime security situation.\nIn the statement on Tuesday, Mr. Lu, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that China would continue to try to settle disputes with “relevant states” through “negotiation and consultation on the basis of respecting historical facts.” For years, China has said it will negotiate with nations over the territorial disputes in the South China Sea only on a bilateral basis and not in a multinational setting.\nLast month, the Chinese military released a broad policy document saying, among other things, that China was placing the projection of naval power in the open ocean on the same priority level as coastal defense.\nForeign analysts of the Chinese military have said for years that one of China’s main aims in modernizing its armed forces was to create a navy capable of carrying out operations far from the mainland. The May paper, the first such policy document in two years, was also the first significant formal statement by the Chinese military of that goal.",

      "text": " MANAMA, Bahrain — A Bahraini court sentenced the country's leading Shiite opposition figure to four years in prison on Tuesday amid an ongoing crackdown on dissent in the tiny island kingdom.\nSheikh Ali Salman, a key figure in the 2011 uprising against the Sunni monarchy, was convicted of insulting the Interior Ministry, which oversees police, inciting others to break the law and inciting hatred against naturalized Sunni citizens, many of whom are of South Asian descent and serve in the country's security forces.\nHowever, the court found Salman not guilty of the most serious charge he faced, which was inciting violence and calling for the overthrow of the monarchy, which carried a potential life sentence. His defense lawyer, Abdullah al-Shamlawi, said Salman can appeal.\nSalman, 49, is the secretary-general of the al-Wefaq political opposition group and was arrested in late December. The charges against him stem from speeches he made between 2012 and 2014.\nAl-Wefaq says his words were taken out of context. His group criticized the verdict.\n\"Keeping Ali Salman in jail means delaying any political solution to come and reflects the government's rejection to a political solution,\" al-Wefaq member Khalil Marzooq said.\nBahrain, which hosts the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, sees near-daily protests backed by the country's Shiite majority, who demand greater say in the government.\nAl-Wefaq is among Bahrain's most vocal and organized opposition groups. The group, which boycotted last year's parliamentary elections, is demanding greater power-sharing between elected lawmakers and the monarchy, the release of political prisoners and a prime minister chosen by elected officials.\nSalman's case has attracted international attention, including criticism from Shiite powerhouse Iran. The European Union warned his arrest could jeopardize the already-difficult security situation in Bahrain. The U.S. has urged that he be tried in a just and transparent way.\nThe government accuses the opposition of repeatedly rejecting offers to hold a national dialogue.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show Salman's age is 49, not 59.\nLoading...

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Ida Perkins! There is surely no poet to equal her. Her stunning debut, “Virgin Again,” marked the beginning of a trail blazed through American letters. Published by T. S. Eliot, praised by Marianne Moore, she earned respect within the academy that didn’t hinder her rise to global celebrity. She was the only person ever to appear simultaneously on the covers of Rolling Stone, Interview and the recherché Tel Quel. Carly Simon and Carole King’s duet version of Ida’s song “Broken Man” went platinum in 1970. Will we ever see her like again? No, we won’t — because Ida Perkins is the creation of Jonathan Galassi in his entertaining first novel, “Muse.” Its hero, Paul Dukach, is an ambitious tyro in 21st-century publishing, the heir apparent at a “tony, impecunious independent publishing house” called Purcell & Stern, whose founder and president, Homer Stern, is the last of the “gentlemen” publishers, “scions of Industrial Revolution fortunes . . . who’d decided to spend what remained of their inheritance on something that was fun for them and perhaps generally worthwhile, too.” But Paul’s true obsession as a littérateur is — you guessed it — Ida Perkins, and Ida is published not by P & S but by Impetus, presided over by the patrician Sterling Wainwright, Stern’s rival and Ida’s distant cousin. Paul’s fascination with his poetic heroine leads him to become an acolyte at more than one altar, employed by Stern but courting Wainwright in order to gain access to Ida. What he discovers along the way will turn the literary world upside down. But that world is already in turmoil, as the author wittily demonstrates over the course of the book. Galassi knows the territory better than most, since he’s president and publisher of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, a publishing house so famous it got its very own biography a couple of years ago. So to say that Galassi — also an acclaimed poet and the translator of the Italian poets Eugenio Montale and Giacomo Leopardi — is an insider in this business is something of an understatement. The book’s first chapter begins with the cry “[Expletive] the peasants!” — the favorite dinnertime toast, apparently, of Roger Straus, the firm’s co-­founder. Publishing is a business under siege: threatened not just by a changing culture that prefers “Breaking Bad” to Baudelaire but also by the warehouse-based, e-book-­promoting business of Amazon, which Galassi recasts, quite wonderfully, as ­“Medusa.” Even Paul can’t avoid using Medusa: “He felt guilty about patronizing the rapacious online bookseller, but the truth was that Styx and Stonze never had what he needed, even in their Madison Square flagship store.” But can a novel that winks so knowingly at a certain group of readers succeed in broader terms? I reckon so. Ida is an enigma, recessed until the very end of the tale. What we glimpse of her poetry in the story’s early pages jars with the degree of her fame, but at the end of the book Galassi’s ventriloquism makes for striking verse. And his riffs on fame itself are spot on; I kept thinking of “Being John Malko­vich,” in which John Cusack’s tormented puppeteer is able to shove marionettes to the top of the cultural heap when at last he inhabits Malkovich and the power of his celebrity. In setting out Ida’s rise and rise, the narrator lays before the reader the poetic clichés of praise: Sure enough, here is “crystalline purity”; “lapidary” — check! Wait, make that “lapidary — obsidian, even.” Now we know it’s poetry. And yet, as the novel pulls to its close, Galassi gives us an alternate world in which we might, really, listen to a poet. \nAdvertisement",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Each Tuesday, The Upshot’s newsletter will feature a selection of comments from an article that resonated with our readers in the past week. Exercise and nutrition are subjects that readers have many passionate opinions about, as we saw again this week after publication of a column by Aaron E. Carroll arguing that exercise — despite its many health benefits — is a far less effective than calorie reduction in losing weight. Laura McNichol of Virginia: I lost over 65 pounds since the beginning of 2014. I gave up soda and sweet tea. I started walking. Then I gave up sugar, which led to giving up pasta, rice and fast food. I eat Fiber One for breakfast with a banana each morning and most evenings for dinner. I eat pretty much whatever I want for lunch. The thing is I don’t want to eat things that will make me feel bad. I get sugar from fruits. I eat bread and butter at a restaurant and still eat french fries and potato chips. My exercise regime consists of walking six plus miles a day with a day off occasionally. I never feel that I have to replace the calories I burn, which is typically over 600 per walk. I eat enough at lunch to get me through my walk. My blood pressure is excellent. My metabolism seems to be great. I look at food as a means to get me through a walk. I beat the big food machine/industry at their game of making highly addictive food. I stay away from the bad stuff and focus on my long-term health. As a 41-year-old, I feel a thousand times better than I ever did in my 20s or 30s. If I can do it, anyone can.

If they promoted healthy eating habits, they would be taking on corporate America, as most of what we eat is unhealthy. Food producers, restaurant chains and supermarket chains would be up in arms if a TV show portrayed what people are really supposed to be eating. We are just slaves to corporate America, and “The Biggest Loser” isn’t going to spark a rebellion because it is owned by another corporation. James Doohan of Montana: Genetics, or unbalanced gut flora or “low metabolism” are an issue in maybe 1 percent of weight problems. The simple fact is that our bodies are incredibly efficient, and we can consume all the calories we need for a day in a matter of minutes. The main problem is overeating. This is not a “blame the victim” attitude; it is simple recognition that we need very little food, but have access to endless calories. Scott W. of Chapel Hill: A few years ago I was sitting in the Philly airport watching people walk by. I decided to count the number of people who were overweight. I counted 21 people in a row who walked by before someone relatively fit strolled by. My standard of fitness was not very strict. Just look around at the people in the malls. We are a very fat country. Mergatroyde of Bedford: When I was about 30, I had enjoyed both a very stable, lean weight and a consistent and healthful diet for years. I worked long hours at a big corporate law firm and typically ate most of my weekday meals at its excellent cafeteria. One day, the firm cafeteria began baking chocolate chip cookies each day at around 3 p.m. Soon my friends and I began to meet almost daily for a short afternoon cookie break. Within two months, having made no changes to my diet or exercise habits other than adding that one delicious daily cookie, I found that my waistbands were garroting my middle. I grudgingly eliminated the cookie, and soon my clothing fit again. This phenomenon was repeated almost exactly a few years later, after Starbucks introduced a particularly delicious coffee drink that I began to crave daily. Once again blooming out of my bloomers, I gave it up (except on Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and Labor Day!). My takeaway: Never allow an indulgence to become a ritual. Even if you’re not doing the math, your body is. Loading...",

      "text": "Nintendo 64s and Vintage PlayStations as Home Décor By ALEX WILLIAMS Supported By Photo The architect and artist Chris McCullough in front of a picture of James Brown made from old cassette tapes. Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In Noah Baumbach’s recent movie, “While We’re Young,” Josh and Cornelia, aging Generation X Brooklynites (played by Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts) who are desperately trying to reclaim their youth, are struck by what passes for home décor in the Bushwick loft of their new, painfully on-trend young friends Jamie and Darby (Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried). Along with the familiar hipster household clichés (the electric typewriter, the wall of vinyl records), the young couple proudly displays a Reagan-era library of movies on VHS tapes, along with a shelf of music cassettes. “It’s like their apartment is full of everything we once threw out,” Cornelia says with an air of wonder. The tech detritus of the 1980s and ’90s is finding a second life as a new generation of artists, designers and geek-nostalgists is repurposing the early-digital-era flotsam of its youth as art, home décor and jewelry, along with plenty of irony-laced kitsch. Think of it as the next evolution of retro-chic style. Self-conscious analog style may have owned the last decade, at least among tastemakers in shuttle-loomed denim with their vintage phonograph players, typewriters and mechanical watches. Photo A desk lamp assembled from an obsolete Sony PlayStation by Jeff Farber. But as the children weaned on Nintendo and Napster mature to the point that they suffer occasional fits of cultural nostalgia, the disposable plastic junk of their youth may finally be ready to have its due. “We’re just to the point where we can look back at the VHS tape and realize how cool it was,” said Erika Iris Simmons, a 31-year-old Chicago artist who works under the name Iri5 , fashioning portraits of luminaries like Jimi Hendrix and Marilyn Monroe not with a brush, but with swirls of tape from old audio and VHS cassettes. To Ms. Simmons, cassette tape recalls a more physical, tactile association that children of the ’80s and ’90s once had with their gadgets; she remembers knowing how to blow into her Nintendo game cartridge just so, to get it working when it would not load. “We all have that shared experience of interacting with the technology that you don’t get to know with MP3s,” she said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In a similar vein, Chris McCullough , 40, a Los Angeles architectural designer who creates art for his spaces, renders portraits of cultural icons like James Brown using audiocassettes like mosaic tiles. Not only are discarded cassettes inexpensive and abundant, he said, but they resonate with audiences his age. “Cassettes represented the first popular portable music medium you could share and personalize yourself,” Mr. McCullough said, before services like Spotify made music “ever disposable.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story (While cassette tapes are technically analog, they reached their cultural zenith in the early digital era of the ’80s, just as PCs were entering the mainstream.) Old Nintendo peripherals themselves can also function as art, or at least eye-catching home décor. Jeff Farber of Oshkosh, Wis., sells pop-art-style desk and floor lamps fashioned from vintage PlayStations and Nintendo 64s and the like on his Etsy shop Woody6Switch, which are intended to celebrate an era when gadgets, even cheap plastic ones, had a certain staying power. “When I was a kid, technology advanced much more slowly than it does today,” Mr. Farber, 36, said. “Like a beloved pet, you took care of it and it gave you joy and entertainment for many, many years.” By contrast, he added, “today’s technology advances and upgrades are so fast that a device you buy today can become virtually obsolete in a matter of months, so there is no real time to fall in love with it the way you could in those golden years of video game infancy.” Photo The artist Erika Iris Simmons, who creates portraits using audiocassette tape. Credit Emily Berl for The New York Times There is certainly no shortage of the stuff. As the life cycle of the average electronic gadget shrinks to a virtual eye blink, the mountains of electronic trash continue to rise, expected to surpass 70 million metric tons this year, from about 19 million in 1990, according to a 2014 report by Step , a United Nations-affiliated sustainability initiative. Except in unusual cases — like the story last month about a Bay Area woman dumping a rare Apple I computer from the 1970s worth $200,000, apparently by accident, at a recycling facility in Milpitas, Calif. — few look at that trash heap and see treasure. But that has started to change. While some regard the so-called upcycling of old gadgets into picture frames or planters as an ecological gesture, others see it as a celebration of shared technological heritage. Jake Harms, 31, who lives in Hildreth, Neb., started a business recycling old iMacs into aquariums and desk lamps in 2007 after a boss directed him to toss an outmoded iMac G3. The candy-colored, egg-shaped desktop computer, introduced in 1998 as one of Steve Jobs’s first iconic pieces during Apple’s late-’90s comeback, seemed too lovely to toss, Mr. Harms reasoned. So after some online research, he decided to turn it into a computer fish tank (a longstanding hobby for some techies), and has since sold more than 1,000, he said. To Mr. Harms, the iMac is functional art, like a classic car. And just as a 1960s Ford Mustang may not make an ideal daily drive but is great for a weekend cruises, “an old computer may not run current software, but make some modifications and it makes a pretty sweet aquarium or lamp,” he said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Apple products created early in the reign of Jonathan Ive, the company’s design guru since 1996, are a natural for reuse as household objects since many were hailed as classics from the outset. For example, Lonnie Mimms, a Georgia real estate executive who owns a collection of vintage computers he values at more than $1 million, recently staged an Apple Pop Up Museum in a former CompUSA store near Atlanta. Other die-hards have fashioned discarded eMacs into pet beds , G4 towers into mailboxes , G5 towers into outdoor benches and G4 Cube computers into tissue boxes . The customer base for these upcycled products tends to be narrow and self-selective. “They’re geeks, they’re nerds,” said Rob Connolly, a retired Floridian who, with his partner, Rita Balcom, makes intricate wall clocks and desk clocks out of old hard drives and motherboards. A few years ago, for example, their company, Tecoart , which sells on Etsy and Amazon, filled an order for 2,400 such pieces from Google, which passed them out as employee incentive awards, he said. Photo The artist Love Hulten and his arcade-game cabinet piece. Not surprisingly, these techie hobbyists share their passion in online communities. One of the more popular forums is a D.I.Y. tech blog run by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories , a family company in Sunnyvale, Calif., that produces open-source hardware. The site features tutorials on making earrings out of linear regulator chips, wine charms from capacitors and a wooden footstool in the shape of a classic 555 integrated circuit chip from the ’70s. “Most of us are deep in the maker communities,” said Lenore Edman, a founder, “so these items are symbols of both our history and our knowledge.” Repurposed tech peripherals are also finding a higher-brow, arty audience. Retro ironists who wish to express their tech nostalgia may consider the Pixelkabinett 42 , a sleek handmade reinterpretation of the classic ’80s arcade game cabinet by the Swedish artist Love Hulten. The limited-edition console contains a vintage computer board and costs about $4,200. “I want to push gaming into a new context, making the arcade cabinet an artistic equivalent to the painting on your wall,” Mr. Hulten, 31, said. Video games from the “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” era can also be found at major museums. Starting July 10, the Brooklyn Museum will present Deluxx Fluxx Arcade , an electric Kool-Aid urban-art reinterpretation of a “Missile Command”-period video arcade by Faile, a Brooklyn-based art duo formed by Patrick McNeil and Patrick Miller, and Bäst, another New York artist. \nAdvertisement ",

Carroll arguing that exercise — despite its many health benefits — is a far less effective than calorie reduction in losing weight.\nLaura McNichol of Virginia:\nI lost over 65 pounds since the beginning of 2014. I gave up soda and sweet tea. I started walking. Then I gave up sugar, which led to giving up pasta, rice and fast food. I eat Fiber One for breakfast with a banana each morning and most evenings for dinner. I eat pretty much whatever I want for lunch. The thing is I don’t want to eat things that will make me feel bad. I get sugar from fruits. I eat bread and butter at a restaurant and still eat french fries and potato chips. My exercise regime consists of walking six plus miles a day with a day off occasionally. I never feel that I have to replace the calories I burn, which is typically over 600 per walk. I eat enough at lunch to get me through my walk. My blood pressure is excellent.

      "text": " My recent article on student debt prompted many questions from readers who were hungry for more detail. I had provided statistics on all undergraduates, but many readers wanted to see debt for those who graduated with a bachelor’s degree.\nWhen you break out the borrowing data by educational attainment, students who get bachelor’s degrees are more likely to borrow than the typical college student. This makes sense: When you stay in school longer, you have more years of tuition to pay and more opportunities to borrow. Fifteen percent of those with a B.A. borrowed more than $30,000, about double the rate of the typical college student. Five percent borrowed more than $50,000, compared with 2 percent of all college students.\nThese data are from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study , the most comprehensive survey of student borrowing. It measured Class of 2003 students’ debt six years after entering college.\nThe longitudinal study is infrequent; we do not have comparable data for a more recent year. But for B.A. recipients there is more up-to-date information from the College Board comparing debt for the graduating classes of 2004, 2008 and 2012. The share of B.A. recipients who borrowed for college rose to 70 percent in 2012 from 65 percent in 2004. Further, the share borrowing relatively large amounts rose sharply. Just 2 percent of the class of 2004 borrowed more than $40,000, but that rose to 8 percent for the class of 2008 and 18 percent for the class of 2012.\nThe increase is particularly sharp at for-profit colleges . The share of students borrowing over $40,000 rose to 48 percent in 2012 from 4 percent in 2004. Students graduating from public colleges borrow the least, with 12 percent of 2012 graduates borrowing more than $40,000, compared with 20 percent at private, nonprofit colleges.\nContinue reading the main story Financing a Bachelor’s Degree Students who received a B.A. borrow more than other students, but only 15 percent borrow more than $30,000 for their education.\nBachelor's Degree Did not borrow $1 to $10,000 $10,001 to $20,000 $20,001 to $30,000 $30,001 to $50,000 $50,001 or more 36% 12 22 14 10 5 Did not borrow $1 to $10,000 $10,001 to $20,000 $20,001 to $30,000 $30,001 to $50,000 $50,001 or more 36% 12 22 14 10 5 Did not borrow $1 to $10,000 $10,001 to $20,000 $20,001 to $30,000 $30,001 to $50,000 $50,001 or more 36% 12 22 14 10 5 Source: Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study These borrowing numbers for B.A. recipients, though higher than those of dropouts, still do not resemble the six-figure debts we hear about in the news media. To find those, we have to look to graduate students. Of the $1.2 trillion in outstanding student-loan debt, 40 percent is borrowing for graduate school. Borrowing is highest among law and medical graduates; their median debt (combined undergraduate and graduate) is $141,000 and $162,000, respectively, for 2012 graduates.\nIf you still want more data, head over to the College Board website , which contains many more graphs and tables on borrowing and tuition, including how they have changed over time.",

      "text": " LONDON — Stanislas Wawrinka took only 49 minutes to beat Australian Nick Kyrgios in the Aegon Championships at Queen's Club on Tuesday as he continued to bask in the glow of his French Open triumph.\nThe Swiss, who stunned Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros earlier this month to claim a second grand slam title, picked up where he left off in Paris with a 6-3 6-4 victory on the sun-drenched west London grasscourts.\nDefending champion Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria also reached the second round, finishing off American Sam Querrey, the 2010 winner, 4-6 6-3 6-4 after bad light interrupted their match at one set all on Monday.\nIt had looked like a tough assignment for second seed Wawrinka against the man who rocked Wimbledon last year by beating Rafa Nadal and reaching the quarter-final on his debut.\nHis free-swinging game can take time to adjust to the slick grass, but he served superbly throughout and produced a few trademark backhands to delight a large crowd.\n\"I'm feeling quite good, for sure. Still need more time on the grass, more adjustment, especially for moving, but today it was a great match,\" Wawrinka, 30, told reporters.\nHe said he had never managed to book a practice session with Kyrgios, despite trying on a few occasions, and would not have learned much about the precocious Aussie in a contest that flashed by before many of the corporate ticket holders had made it back from lunch.\nKyrgios never looked happy as he set foot back on the grass after pulling out of last week's tournament in Den Bosch with an elbow problem and threatened only briefly, when he had two break points at 2-3 in the second set.\nWawrinka snuffed out that danger, though, and moved through to set up a meeting with big-serving South African Kevin Anderson.\nLater on a high-quality day of first-round action at the traditional pre-Wimbledon tune-up, Rafa Nadal, fresh from winning the Stuttgart title on grass, faces Alexandr Dolgopolov and three-times former champion Andy Murray plays Lu Yen-hsun.\n(Editing by Ed Osmond)\n ",

      "text": "JUNE 2, 2015 The British Foreign Office has not been able to confirm that Mr. Asmal was one of the suicide bombers, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday. But members of his family in the West Yorkshire town of Dewsbury in northern England said in a statement that the bearded teenager in the Islamic State posts looked like their son. Photo Talha Asmal, a British teenager who apparently detonated a car full of explosives at Iraq’s largest oil refinery, in an image posted on a militant website. Credit via Associated Press Mr. Asmal’s parents described him as “loving, kind, caring and affable” and said they believed their son was radicalized on the Internet and in social media in the space of only a few months. They accused Islamic State leaders of cowardice for grooming their son to carry out their “dirty work.” Like other Western countries, Britain has experienced the flight of hundreds of its young Muslims, many of them minors, to Syria, as schools and parents struggle to detect signs of a radicalization that often seems to happen largely online. Another recent case involved the departure of three schoolgirls from the Bethnal Green neighborhood in East London in February. Grainy security-camera images of the girls — ages 15 and 16 — confidently passing through airport security shocked the country. Like the girls from Bethnal Green, Mr. Asmal did not go on his own. He traveled with a friend and neighbor, Hassan Munshi, also 17, and told his parents that he was going on a school trip, according to The Times of London. By the time the police issued an alert, it was too late: The two teenagers had already flown to a resort in eastern Turkey and then slipped across the border into Syria. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Munshi is nowhere to be found. Security officials say that the case of his older brother, Hammaad Munshi , may have contributed to the boys’ radicalization: He was convicted in 2008 at the age of 18 for his role in a plot to kill non-Muslims. One of the images posted online by the Islamic State appears to show Mr. Asmal, wearing a black shirt and smiling broadly, standing next to a black Toyota with the Islamic State flag behind him. Another shows him sitting on the floor with an assault rifle on his lap. Saad Maan, a spokesman for the Iraqi Interior Ministry, said the authorities were aware that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had claimed responsibility for the attack and had asserted that one of the bombers was a Briton. But he said Iraqi investigators had not established the identity of the bomber. He said the group frequently used foreigners as suicide bombers. \nAdvertisement ",

      "text": " LIGNY, Belgium — Napoleon Bonaparte , also known as Frank Samson, a pudgy Paris lawyer who likes wearing gold braided uniforms and a black bicorne hat, won his last battle on Sunday in southern Belgium.\nFeting the “glorious performance” of French troops in a field of thigh-high wheat, rented for the day from a farmer for a mock showdown between the armies of France and Prussia, he predicted that whatever the outcome of a forthcoming confrontation with the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo this week, he had already won the war.\n“In terms of glory and of history, it is Napoleon who stays in people’s minds, not Wellington,” said Mr. Samson, relishing cries of “Long Live the Emperor” as he dismounted from his white horse after a restaging of Napoleon’s triumphant last day in the sun on June 16, 1815.\nThe re-enactment of the Battle of Ligny, a picturesque French-speaking village south of Brussels, marked the start of a weeklong series of events to commemorate Napoleon’s ultimate defeat at Waterloo on June 18, 1815. But while Britain and its victorious allies remember Waterloo as a decisive triumph that reshaped Europe in their favor, Mr. Samson and other, mostly French, fans of the defeated emperor instead celebrate the enduring celebrity and allure of their routed hero.\nIn the case of Napoleon, losers, not victors, have managed to write much of the history.\n“Napoleon, without a shadow of doubt, won the postwar publicity and PR campaign. This was where Wellington fell flat on his face,” said Alasdair White, a British expert on the period and author of books on the 1815 struggle between France and a British-led alliance.\nIn Ligny over the weekend, stalls set up near the battlefield were filled with tributes to Napoleon — statues, busts, books, death masks as well as T-shirts, posters and knickknacks all bearing his image. Wellington was nowhere to be seen.\nA Franco-Belgian company hawked a book titled, “The French Victory at Waterloo,” a study of a little known battle fought in 1794. That battle had nothing to do with Napoleon but still cheers the spirits of fans for whom Waterloo is a place usually associated with French ignominy.\nAdvertisement\n Eager to revive memories of how, for a time, it looked as if France could win in 1815, Mr. Samson rode off the battlefield here on Sunday and declared that defeating Wellington would be a “picnic” after the slaughter at Ligny, a gruesome battle that left around 20,000 French and Prussian soldiers dead or wounded.\nIn reality, the Battle of Ligny, re-enacted by Mr. Samson and around 1,500 other history enthusiasts dressed in period costumes, marked the final spasm of French military pride before a catastrophic fall at Waterloo that put an end to all French hopes of hegemony in Europe, and led to Napoleon’s banishment to St. Helena, an island in the South Atlantic.\nFor a day, however, a 47-year-old lawyer dressed up as Napoleon — and bearing a striking resemblance to the real thing — and fans of the Corsica-born soldier who declared himself emperor and turned France into the superpower of his day savored their hero’s final day of glory.\nAdvertisement\n “We won today and we are going to win again,” Mr. Samson said in his role as Napoleon. Speaking as himself, after hours racing across a wheat field on a horse in the sun, he said: “What I really want now is a cold beer.”\nWith a touch of melancholy, he added that he would not try to rewrite history and would accept whatever fate awaits him at Waterloo, where he and more than 5,000 war re-enactors and 300 horses will, on Friday and Saturday, restage the climactic battle, an event billed as the biggest re-enactment ever staged in Europe.\nThe defeat at Waterloo on June 18, 1815, was so calamitous for France’s ambitions to implant the goals of the 1789 French Revolution across Europe that the 19th-century writer Victor Hugo said it “wasn’t a battle. It was a change of direction in the universe.” Hugo blamed God, or at least the heavens, for Napoleon’s defeat, complaining that heavy rain the night before made it difficult for Napoleon to maneuver his artillery and tilted the conflict unfairly Wellington’s way.\nOther Frenchmen have insisted that Napoleon actually won. “This defeat shimmers with an aura of victory,” former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin wrote in an admiring book about Napoleon.\nClaudine Coulon, a resident of Ligny, once part of Napoleon’s empire but part of Belgium for nearly 200 years, hoisted a French flag outside her home to show whose side her family was on during the mock battle taking place on the wheat field across the road. “I am so happy. This is a big win for Napoleon,” she said.\nShe also put out pots planted with what she had hoped would be flowers in the colors of France — blue, white and red — but which turned out to be purple, white and brown.\nNapoleon, she said, should have stayed put in Ligny, where he defeated a Prussian Army under Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, instead of marching north to confront Wellington at Waterloo. “It would have turned out better if he had just stayed here,” Ms. Coulon said.\nThe French government has shown no interest in the events this week to mark the 200th anniversary of Napoleon’s defeat.\nWhile Britain and the Netherlands, two of the principal victors in 1815, are sending members of their royal families to Belgium for the Waterloo commemorations, France is sending only its ambassador in Brussels. Germany, heir to Prussia’s share of the Waterloo victory honors, is also staying away aside from its ambassador, wary of celebrating a Prussian military tradition that post-Nazi Germany has worked hard to forget.\n“The French are not keen on celebrating Waterloo for obvious reasons,” Robert Tombs, a history professor at the University of Cambridge, said. “It ended a whole phase of European history, one of French predominance which had lasted more than a century, and started a period of British and Russian predominance,” he added.\nSo shattering was Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo that many of Napoleon’s fans, past and present, have sought to recast the debacle as a moral triumph or found ways to exculpate the emperor himself from any blame, claiming that he suffered from a painful bout of hemorrhoids that knocked him off his winning stride, and also from treachery within his own command.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n Mr. Samson said after his victory on Sunday that he was feeling well but did “have some bother in the posterior.”\nMr. White, the British expert on the Battle of Waterloo, dismissed the hemorrhoid story as “an absolute myth” invented by French supporters of Napoleon who “cannot believe that the great man lost so there must have been something wrong with him.”\nThe real reason for his defeat, Mr. White said, was that Napoleon was far past his prime and “was no longer the great military leader he had been in 1805,” when he routed far bigger Russian and Austrian forces at Austerlitz, and had “not won a major battle since 1812. He was tired and made too many mistakes.”\nOnce the battle was over, however, Napoleon quickly got the upper hand in rewriting history.\nWhile Wellington went into politics, becoming a deeply conservative and highly unpopular prime minister in London, Napoleon used his exile on St. Helena to work on his memoirs with a French historian, a vast self-serving work that became an international best-seller in the 19th century. It cemented Napoleon’s legendary status, presenting him as a servant to the ideals, but not the brutality, of the French Revolution and blaming his failures on disloyal subordinates and plain bad luck.\n“His version of events is fundamentally wrong but it became the version of events,” Mr. White, the British expert, said.\nMr. Samson, who has been playing Napoleon for more than 10 years in battle re-enactments around Europe, said he planned to retire from his role as emperor after Waterloo. “I am much better known than Wellington,” Mr. Samson said, speaking for Napoleon. “Wellington won the battle. But I won the war.”\nLoading...

      "text": "MAY 5, 2015 It took a few months, but one night, she crept into her mother’s room and sat on the bed, crying. When she finally came out with what was bothering her, her mother’s first impulse was to comfort her, holding her hand and saying: “It’s O.K. It’s O.K.” But inside, Gail Boone was terrified. She had wondered if her son were gay, and that, she says, would have been easier to deal with than a child who wanted to be the opposite sex. “There’s this fear,” Ms. Boone said, “what is this going to do to my kid, what are people going to think, what are people going to think about me?” Kat’s father, Andrew, had moved out when she was in fifth grade, and it took a few months for Kat and her mother to find the courage to tell him. Gail Boone had a background in psychology, which helped her understand. Mr. Boone, an operations and project manager, had a harder time, but was brought around for the sake of his child. He read books about being transgender and raked his memory for clues in Kat’s early childhood, but could not find any. “Maybe she thinks this is the thing, and there’s something else going on,” he remembered thinking. “How do we know?” He wished there were something scientific like a blood test that would give him 100 percent certainty. Mr. Boone recalls going into “a zombie trance,” a period of mourning for the child he thought he knew. “I was really eating myself up because I couldn’t help this overwhelming feeling as if my child had died,” he said. “But here was my child right in front of me.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It was the cutting that convinced them that if she could not live as a girl, Kat would kill herself. She still has two angry scars on her left forearm. “It became clear to me that this wasn’t a passing phase or some choice or reaction,” Mr. Boone said. “This was truly the basis of what she was.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story At 16 and a half, after seeing a therapist, Kat began taking estrogen and a blood-pressure drug, spironolactone, that is also used to block the actions of testosterone, to help her look more female. In the fall of junior year, she showed up at school wanting to be called Katherine, or Kat, because she likes cats. She does not want anything to do with her birth name, Caden. She also has discovered that she likes girls. “I identify as a lesbian,” she said, though her attractions have not been reciprocated. Part of what brought her father around was the support network that has sprung up around transgender issues. In Syracuse, it is the Q (for queer or questioning) Center, run by the nonprofit ACR Health . It is not easy to find. Visitors have to be buzzed in through an unmarked back door in a shabby neighborhood. But inside, it is homey, with a well-appointed library, a kitchen and a meeting room outfitted with beanbag chairs.

Credit Heather Ainsworth for The New York Times A meeting of teenagers in April began with each one declaring a name and pronoun of the day. Their choices were not always intuitively obvious. A young man with a scruffy beard and shaggy hair asked to be called Jackie and with the pronoun “she.” “One of the nice things a trans person gets to do during transition is pick a new name,” said the facilitator, Mallory Livingston, a lawyer, “assigned male at birth,” now looking feminine in a tight pink camisole, black lace-up boots and miniskirt. “I went with the name of a character from my kids’ favorite movie, a strong female swordsperson.” But there were hints of the pain the children had to endure. One child was required to use a separate bathroom at school, and a hidden camera was later found there. Kat told the group that she was looking forward to surgery in six days. They clapped. “I’m scared,” she confessed. A Young Movement The ability to alter a child’s gender physically has never been greater. But the drive to treat children is relatively new. One of the first and biggest hormone programs for young teenagers in the United States is led by a Harvard-affiliated pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Norman Spack , at Boston Children’s Hospital. Dr. Spack recalled being at a meeting in Europe about 15 years ago, when he learned that the Dutch were using puberty blockers in transgender early adolescents. “I was salivating,” he recalled. “I said, we had to do this.” The puberty-blocking protocol gained legitimacy in 2009, when it was endorsed by the Endocrine Society, the leading association of hormone experts, on the recommendation of a task force including Dr. Spack. The protocol calls for administering puberty-blocking drugs, generally Lupron, an injection, or histrelin, an implant, that are normally used to treat precocious puberty as well as prostate cancer and endometriosis, abnormal growth of uterine tissue. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The theory is that this drug-induced lull from about 12 to 16 — sometimes younger — will help teenagers decide whether they truly are transgender, without committing to irreversible physical changes. Puberty blockers are reversible. But in practice, some experts warn, once children have “socially transitioned” it is very difficult to go back. Photo Kat Boone this month with her surgeon, Dr. Christine McGinn, who is also a transgender woman. Credit Andrew Spear for The New York Times If a psychological evaluation confirms gender dysphoria, teenagers are treated with cross-sex hormones (estrogen for boys, testosterone for girls), so they will, in effect, go through opposite-sex puberty. A consequence of going through the whole protocol is infertility. The blockers cost thousands of dollars a year, and like all drugs used for transgender treatment, have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that use, though they may be legally prescribed “off label.” Dr. Spack said his clinic had treated about 200 children since 2007, and less than 20 percent had been covered by insurance. “That’s where the dilemma came in: Who the hell could afford it?” he said. Doctors say that if children are started on puberty blockers young enough, insurance is less likely to question it. Some doctors have been able to drive the price down to $120 a month by getting the adult implant, which is much cheaper than the pediatric one, from sympathetic urologists and stretching it out over two years instead of just one. While hormones for minors are sometimes covered by insurance, surgery almost never is. But several doctors said they had performed surgery on minors. Kat’s surgeon, Dr. Christine McGinn, estimated that she had done more than 30 operations on children under 18, about half of them vaginoplasties for biological boys becoming girls, and the other half double mastectomies for girls becoming boys. “We’re trying to find the sweet spot,” Dr. McGinn said. “The problem is, it’s not an age, it’s a situation.” Advocates say that extending treatment to teenagers will alleviate depression and suicide. With that in mind, Oregon’s Medicaid began covering the gamut of treatment, regardless of age, in January. Patients as young as 15 do not need parental consent. The evidence is mixed. A large-scale Swedish study at the Karolinska Institute found that starting about a decade after gender reassignment surgery, the transgender suicide rate was still 19 times higher than for the general population. Complicating matters, studies suggest that most young children with gender dysphoria eventually lose any desire to change sex, and may grow up to be gay, rather than transgender. Once into adolescence, however, their dysphoria is more likely to stick. Dr. Paul McHugh , a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University Medical School and its hospital’s former psychiatrist in chief, is skeptical of the use of surgery for a psychological condition, and even more so for children. “Bruce Jenner — who cares?” said Dr. McHugh, who said he played a role in closing a transgender surgery program at Johns Hopkins about 35 years ago. “He’s a wonderfully successful person. He’s got all kinds of social networks. He’s got plenty of money. No one’s objecting to him if he wants to live as a woman. This is America, be my guest. \nAdvertisement ",

      "text": "JUNE 2, 2015 The British Foreign Office has not been able to confirm that Mr. Asmal was one of the suicide bombers, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday. But members of his family in the West Yorkshire town of Dewsbury in northern England said in a statement that the bearded teenager in the Islamic State posts looked like their son. Photo Talha Asmal, a British teenager who apparently detonated a car full of explosives at Iraq’s largest oil refinery, in an image posted on a militant website. Credit via Associated Press Mr. Asmal’s parents described him as “loving, kind, caring and affable” and said they believed their son was radicalized on the Internet and in social media in the space of only a few months. They accused Islamic State leaders of cowardice for grooming their son to carry out their “dirty work.” Like other Western countries, Britain has experienced the flight of hundreds of its young Muslims, many of them minors, to Syria, as schools and parents struggle to detect signs of a radicalization that often seems to happen largely online. Another recent case involved the departure of three schoolgirls from the Bethnal Green neighborhood in East London in February. Grainy security-camera images of the girls — ages 15 and 16 — confidently passing through airport security shocked the country. Like the girls from Bethnal Green, Mr. Asmal did not go on his own. He traveled with a friend and neighbor, Hassan Munshi, also 17, and told his parents that he was going on a school trip, according to The Times of London. By the time the police issued an alert, it was too late: The two teenagers had already flown to a resort in eastern Turkey and then slipped across the border into Syria. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Munshi is nowhere to be found. Security officials say that the case of his older brother, Hammaad Munshi , may have contributed to the boys’ radicalization: He was convicted in 2008 at the age of 18 for his role in a plot to kill non-Muslims. One of the images posted online by the Islamic State appears to show Mr. Asmal, wearing a black shirt and smiling broadly, standing next to a black Toyota with the Islamic State flag behind him. Another shows him sitting on the floor with an assault rifle on his lap. Saad Maan, a spokesman for the Iraqi Interior Ministry, said the authorities were aware that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had claimed responsibility for the attack and had asserted that one of the bombers was a Briton. But he said Iraqi investigators had not established the identity of the bomber. He said the group frequently used foreigners as suicide bombers. \nAdvertisement",

      "text": "Neuroscience Inspires Cartoon Action in Pixar's 'Inside Out' By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS JUNE 15, 2015, 9:22 A.M. E.D.T. Inside Continue reading the main story LOS ANGELES — Drawing on real neuroscience and the latest psychological research, \"Inside Out\" goes where no animated film has gone before: Deep inside the workings of a young girl's mind. The much anticipated Pixar release, the studio's first in two years, bills itself as \"a major emotion picture.\" Opening Friday, it centers on 11-year-old Riley, a happy, hockey-loving kid. Most of the action, though, takes place inside her head, where her staff of personified emotions — Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear and Disgust — is in charge of operations. When Riley is shaken by her family's move across the country, her emotions must navigate through her subconscious, dreams and memories to restore balance and protect her burgeoning personality. It's not just heady territory for an animated family film. Experts say it's scientifically accurate and could expand popular understanding of human emotions. \"It really tells us something very true and unique about emotional experience,\" said psychology professor Dacher Keltner of University of California, Berkeley, an expert in the study of emotions who consulted with Pixar on the film and saw an early screening. \"The film suggests that, in a way, all emotions have their purpose, and that is very much in line with the recent science.\" Writer-director Pete Docter wanted to deeply understand the science behind such intellectual concepts as personality and memory before visually interpreting them on screen. He studied scientific papers and cross-checked story ideas with Keltner and other brain and behavior experts as he developed the film. \"I felt a pretty heavy responsibility (to accuracy),\" Docter said. \"It sort of stymied me for a while in making decisions. I remember sweating in my office, like... I don't know, what if I get it wrong?\" Pixar artists were tasked with imagining how to depict memories: How would they be kept and stored? How are they forgotten and where do they go? They dreamed up ways to represent intangible things like personality and the subconscious. Ultimately, scientific accuracy took a backseat to story, Docter said: \"We didn't want to do anything that would get us laughed out of the room, but we definitely stretched things and took some leeway.\" In the film, Riley is upset when her family's move from Minnesota to San Francisco forces her to leave her best friend and her hockey team and start at a new school. Inside her head, Joy (Amy Poehler) normally reigns over the staff of emotions, but Sadness (Phyllis Smith) steps in after the move. As Joy vies for control, she and Sadness get lost deep in the recesses of Riley's mind, leaving Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) at the helm. Riley appears angry and sullen to the outside world until Joy and Sadness make peace and return to their positions inside \"headquarters.\" Poehler called the film's take on emotions \"a revolutionary concept.\" \"We tell ourselves that the constant pursuit of happiness is what we need to do, and if you're not doing it, you're doing something wrong,\" she said. \"Instead, this big concept of feeling your feelings and trying to stay true to who you are and what you want, that's the journey. That's life, man!\" \nAdvertisement",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. and Justice Department prosecutors are investigating front-office officials for the St. Louis Cardinals , one of the most successful teams in baseball over the past two decades, for hacking into the internal networks of a rival team to steal closely guarded information about player personnel. Investigators have uncovered evidence that Cardinals officials broke into a network of the Houston Astros that housed special databases the team had built, according to law enforcement officials. Internal discussions about trades, proprietary statistics and scouting reports were compromised, the officials said. The officials did not say which employees were the focus of the investigation or whether the team’s highest-ranking officials were aware of the hacking or authorized it. The investigation is being led by the F.B.I.’s Houston field office and has progressed to the point that subpoenas have been served on the Cardinals and Major League Baseball for electronic correspondence.

Phillip/Associated Press The attack represents the first known case of corporate espionage in which a professional sports team has hacked the network of another team. Illegal intrusions into companies’ networks have become commonplace, but it is generally conducted by hackers operating in foreign countries, like Russia and China, who steal large tranches of data or trade secrets for military equipment and electronics. Major League Baseball “has been aware of and has fully cooperated with the federal investigation into the illegal breach of the Astros’ baseball operations database,” a spokesman for baseball’s commissioner, Rob Manfred, said in a written statement. The Cardinals officials under investigation have not been put on leave, suspended or fired. The commissioner’s office is likely to wait until the conclusion of the government’s investigation to determine whether to take disciplinary action against the officials or the team. The case is a rare mark of ignominy for the Cardinals, one of the sport’s most revered and popular organizations. The team has the best record in baseball this season (42-21), regularly commands outsize television ratings and has reached the National League Championship Series nine times since 2000. The Cardinals, who last won the World Series in 2011, have 11 titles over all, second only to the Yankees. Their owner, Bill DeWitt, is a highly regarded executive who last year was in charge of the search committee for a new commissioner to replace the retiring Bud Selig. Law enforcement officials believe the hacking was executed by vengeful front-office employees for the Cardinals hoping to wreak havoc on the work of Jeff Luhnow, the Astros’ general manager who had been a successful and polarizing executive with the Cardinals until 2011. From 1994 to 2012, the Astros and the Cardinals were division rivals, in the National League. For a part of that time, Mr. Luhnow was a Cardinals executive, primarily handling scouting and player development. One of many innovative thinkers drawn to the sport by the “Moneyball” phenomenon, he was credited with building baseball’s best minor league system, as well as drafting several players who would become linchpins of the Cardinals’ 2011 World Series-winning team. \nAdvertisement ",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday gave the food industry three years to eliminate artery-clogging, artificial trans fats from the food supply, a step that health experts said would save thousands of lives a year.\nTrans fats — a major contributor to heart disease in the United States — have already been substantially reduced in foods, but they still lurk in many popular products, including frostings, microwave popcorn, packaged pies, frozen pizzas, margarines and coffee creamers.\nThe F.D.A. first announced its plans to ban the substance in 2013, and its announcement on Tuesday was its final ruling. Companies will have three years to comply. The agency has estimated that banning trans fats completely could prevent 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths from heart disease each year.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Facing Consumer Pressure, Companies Start to Seek Safe Alternatives to BPA JUNE 15, 2015 “This is the final nail in the coffin of trans fats,” said Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group. “In terms of lives saved, I think eliminating trans fats is the single most important change to our food supply.”\nThe agency has proposed that partially hydrogenated oils, the source of trans fats, no longer be “generally recognized as safe.”\nThat means companies would have to prove that such oils are safe to eat, a high hurdle given that scientific literature overwhelmingly shows the contrary. The Institute of Medicine has concluded that there is no safe level for consumption of them, a conclusion that the F.D.A. cited in its reasoning.\nPartially hydrogenated oils are cheaper than saturated animal fats like butter, and for years were thought to be healthier. They are formed when liquid oil is treated with hydrogen gas and made solid. They became popular in fried and baked goods and in margarine. Crisco , originally marketed in the beginning of the 20th century, was the archetype, although it now contains no trans fat.\nBut over the years, scientific evidence has shown they are dangerous because they raise the levels of so-called bad cholesterol and can lower the levels of good cholesterol.\nSince 2006, companies have been required by the F.D.A. to include trans fat content information on their nutrition labels, a shift that prompted many large producers to eliminate them. That same year, New York City banned the use of trans fats in foods sold by restaurants and bakeries; other places, including California, Cleveland and Philadelphia, followed suit. Many major chains, including McDonald’s, found substitutes and sharply reduced the use of trans fats.\nThe F.D.A. estimates that consumption of trans fats fell by a stunning 78 percent from 2003 to 2012, and it contends that the labeling rule and subsequent reformulation of foods were important drivers. Americans ate about one gram a day in 2012, down from 4.6 grams in 2006.\nMr. Jacobson said that about 85 percent of trans fats in the food supply have been eliminated. Tuesday’s ruling would remove nearly all of what remains.\nTrans fats won’t be completely gone. They occur naturally in meat and dairy products, and are produced at very low levels in some edible oils during the manufacturing process, the F.D.A. said. And companies will be able to petition the F.D.A. for specific uses of certain partially hydrogenated oils.\n“The F.D.A.’s action on this major source of artificial trans fat demonstrates the agency’s commitment to the heart health of all Americans,” said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the F.D.A.’s acting commissioner. “This action is expected to reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year.”\nLoading...

      "text": " The financial crisis made Americans less worried about climate change . The Democrats’ attempt to pass sweeping climate legislation in 2009 and 2010 probably reduced Americans’ anxiety level as well, as paradoxical as that may sound. But now Americans are getting more worried again.\nAbout 69 percent of adults say that global warming is either a “very serious” or “somewhat serious” problem, according to a new Pew Research Center poll , up from 63 percent in 2010. The level of concern has still not returned to that of a decade ago; in 2006, 79 percent of adults called global warming serious.\nIt’s impossible to know exactly why concern about the climate fell — and why skepticism that global warming was real increased — starting around 2008. Both economics and politics probably play a role. The financial crisis and recession made Americans more worried about the immediate condition of the economy, rather than about the long-term condition of the planet.\nAnd President Obama’s election, combined with an attempt by many Democrats to pass a climate bill, apparently caused many Republican-leaning voters to become more hostile to new climate policies. Such polarization is common across many issues, political scientists note . “As party control shifted” in 2009, note Jessica Martinez, Greg Smith and Jocelyn Kiley of Pew, “the debate about energy also shifted, and could have contributed to changes in opinion over all.”\nPhoto The coal-fired Plant Scherer in Juliette, Ga., in 2014. Credit John Amis/Associated Press In the last few years, however, discussion of a major climate bill has receded, while the economy has started to improve — and problems from global warming, though increasing only gradually, are increasing .\nThe percentage of Americans who agree with the scientific consensus — that global warming is occurring and caused by human activity — has also bounced back in the last few years. Sixty-eight percent of Americans also say there is “solid evidence of warming,” up from 57 percent in 2009.\nSkepticism about climate change remains high among nearly any demographic group that leans Republican, including men, whites, evangelicals and people over age 50, according to the Pew data. The main reason is that so many Republicans themselves are skeptical that the planet has become hotter and are opposed to new climate policies. But even Democratic men are slighhtly less interested in combating climate change than Democratic women.\nThere is little chance anytime soon for major legislation to address climate change, because Republicans oppose such measures and control Congress. When Democrats controlled Congress in 2009 and 2010, the House passed a broad bill but it could not get through the Senate. President Obama has since been trying to reduce carbon emissions, which cause warming, through regulation. Coal companies and other groups are fighting those regulations in the courts, and some of the issues may eventually reach the Supreme Court.\nOther polls, including by Gallup and The New York Times and Stanford University , have similarly shown that concern about climate change fell sometime after 2008 and has since risen.\nContinue reading the main story Climate Worries, Rising Again Share of Americans who call global warming a “serious” problem\n% 70 60 50 69% 2011 2009 2013 2007 June Source: Pew Research Center Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The new public-opinion data is part of a Pew poll centered on Roman Catholics. On Thursday, Pope Francis will release an encyclical, or major teaching letter, focused on the environment’s effect on the poor. The views of American Catholics on climate change largely track those of non-Catholics, Pew found. That’s no surprise: Catholics also vote in very similar patterns as non-Catholics.\nOne small exception on climate change is that Catholic Republicans are slightly more concerned about climate change than non-Catholic Republicans, although the gap is small: Most Catholic Republicans are also skeptical that human activity is heating the planet.\nSeparately, the Pew poll found that Pope Francis, two years into his papacy, continues to be very popular among American Catholics. About 86 percent rate him favorably, compared with 74 percent who rated Pope Benedict XVI favorably two years into his term. No identical data exists for Pope John Paul II so early in his term. Nine years into his tenure, in 1987, 91 percent of American Catholics rated him favorably.\n“My intuition from reading of the poll data suggests that among American Catholics, Pope Francis is about as popular as Pope John Paul II at a similar point in his papacy,” said John C. Green, a professor of political science at the University of Akron. “Both popes were Vatican outsiders (one from Poland, one from Argentina), brought new perspectives to world issues, and were very personable.”\nIn the encyclical, Francis will call for action to avoid an “unprecedented destruction of the ecosystem,” according to The Guardian , based on an early copy of the document obtained by L’Espresso magazine.\n“Humanity is called to take note of the need for changes in lifestyle and changes in methods of production and consumption to combat this warming, or at least the human causes that produce and accentuate it,” the document says. “The attitudes that stand in the way of a solution, even among believers, range from negation of the problem, to indifference, to convenient resignation or blind faith in technical solutions.”",

Skepticism about climate change remains high among nearly any demographic group that leans Republican, including men, whites, evangelicals and people over age 50, according to the Pew data. The main reason is that so many Republicans themselves are skeptical that the planet has become hotter and are opposed to new climate policies. But even Democratic men are slighhtly less interested in combating climate change than Democratic women. There is little chance anytime soon for major legislation to address climate change, because Republicans oppose such measures and control Congress. When Democrats controlled Congress in 2009 and 2010, the House passed a broad bill but it could not get through the Senate. President Obama has since been trying to reduce carbon emissions, which cause warming, through regulation. Coal companies and other groups are fighting those regulations in the courts, and some of the issues may eventually reach the Supreme Court. Other polls, including by Gallup and The New York Times and Stanford University , have similarly shown that concern about climate change fell sometime after 2008 and has since risen.",

Credit Stuart Isett for The New York Times \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story For more than a century, the United States Golf Association has staged its main Open championship on treacherously traditional courses across America, but this week it is in uncharted territory: links-like Chambers Bay on a sandy shore of Puget Sound near Tacoma, Wash. With the 115th Open the first in the Pacific Northwest, it’s as if Chambers Bay is auditioning. Will it be worthy of joining Oakmont, Winged Foot, Pebble Beach and others in the Open rotation? Or will it be a one-time novelty? The identity of the winner could provide the answer. Just as names make news in journalism, names make the reputation of a golf course. The best Open courses invariably elevate the best golfers onto the leaderboard, if not to the trophy ceremony. Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan and Bobby Jones, the best golfers of their eras, share the Open record with four victories. Tiger Woods, a sure Hall of Famer in his era, has won three. In determining the quality of Open courses, one method is to look for winners who have multiple Open titles and have been enshrined in the World Golf Hall of Fame. Photo Jack Nicklaus on the way to winning the 1962 Open at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania. Credit Associated Press OAKMONT COUNTRY CLUB Oakmont, Pa. According to the best-golfers formula, Oakmont emerges as the best of the best. There have been eight Opens since 1927 on the slick greens and deep bunkers in the rolling hills outside Pittsburgh, and seven winners there earned a total of 14 Open titles: Nicklaus and Hogan (four each), Ernie Els (two), Johnny Miller, Larry Nelson, Tommy Armour and Ángel Cabrera. All are in the Hall of Fame except Cabrera, the 2007 winner, but with the 2009 Masters title also on his résumé, he will probably join them. Oakmont’s only surprising winner, the exception that proves the rule, was Sam Parks Jr., a 25-year-old pro at the nearby South Hills course who stopped by Oakmont to practice for a month before the 1935 Open. With a final-round 76 for a 72-hole score of 299, 11 over par, he was two strokes ahead of the long-hitting Jimmy Thomson and three ahead of Walter Hagen, a two-time Open champion. \nAdvertisement Photo Bobby Jones won the 1929 Open at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y. Credit Associated Press Aside from the removal of some 170 bunkers from its original 350, and a slight move of the eighth green to allow the Pennsylvania Turnpike to split the course in 1949, Oakmont is virtually unchanged from the layout that the steel baron Henry Fownes founded in 1903. In 1987 it became the first golf course in the United States to be declared a national historic landmark. See More » WINGED FOOT GOLF CLUB Mamaroneck, N.Y. Winged Foot, where the greens supposedly break toward the New York skyline, was baptized as an Open course in 1929 by Jones. He won a 36-hole playoff with the little-known Al Espinosa by 23 strokes. Billy Casper won his first career Open at Winged Foot in 1959 and won his second at Olympic in a 1966 playoff with Arnold Palmer. Hale Irwin won at Winged Foot in 1974 and later added two more Open titles to his Hall of Fame credentials. Fuzzy Zoeller routed Greg Norman in a 1984 playoff at Winged Foot. In 2006, the last time Winged Foot hosted the Open, Phil Mickelson was leading at the final hole but sliced his tee shot off a hospitality tent, leading to a double bogey and a victory for Geoff Ogilvy.

On the cliffs above Carmel Bay in Northern California, Pebble Beach didn’t join the Open rotation until 1972, but its winners enriched its scenery. Nicklaus won that year. Tom Watson’s pitch from the rough for a birdie 2 on the 71st hole edged Nicklaus in 1982. Tom Kite, another Hall of Famer, won in 1991, and Woods shattered a record in 2000, winning by 15 strokes. Graeme McDowell won his first major there in 2010. MERION GOLF CLUB Ardmore, Pa. On the leafy Main Line near Philadelphia, Merion has produced three Hall of Fame winners: Hogan in 1950, 16 months after his near-fatal highway crash; Lee Trevino, in a playoff with Nicklaus, in 1971; and David Graham in 1981. After a 32-year absence from the rotation, Merion hosted the 2013 Open, with Justin Rose holding off Mickelson .

When Shinnecock Hills, in the Hamptons, joined the rotation in 1986, Raymond Floyd validated it with the third of four major titles in his Hall of Fame portfolio. Retief Goosen added to his Hall of Fame hopes there by winning his second Open in 2004. Shinnecock Hills will host the 2018 Open. PINEHURST NO. 2 Pinehurst, N.C. Pinehurst No. 2, in the North Carolina pinelands, was inserted into the rotation in 1999, when Payne Stewart nipped Mickelson. Stewart died four months later in a jet crash. Martin Kaymer, another Hall of Fame candidate, dominated the field at Pinehurst last year, winning by eight strokes.

Credit Vincent Laforet/The New York Times BETHPAGE BLACK COURSE Farmingdale, N.Y. Bethpage Black, a refurbished public course on Long Island, made its debut in 2002 with Woods winning his fourth straight major . It was the last time a golfer won the Masters and the United States Open in the same year. In the 2009 Open at Bethpage, Mickelson was again in contention during the final round, but he was the runner-up to the journeyman Lucas Glover.  Photo Raymond Floyd at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club on Long Island after winning the 1986 Open. Credit David Cannon/Getty Images Some formidable Open courses have fallen out of the rotation. Baltusrol, in the northern New Jersey suburbs, where Nicklaus won in 1967 and 1980, was sidetracked to the P.G.A. Championship, which Mickelson, already a Hall of Famer, won there in 2005. The P.G.A. will be there again next year. Before hosting the P.G.A. twice, Oak Hill, outside Rochester, had three Opens, each won by a Hall of Famer: Cary Middlecoff in 1956, Trevino in 1968 and Curtis Strange in 1989. Photo Pinehurst Resort and Golf Club in North Carolina joined the rotation of top Open sites when Payne Stewart won there in 1999. Credit Tom Able Green/Getty Images Oakland Hills, near Detroit, had three Hall of Fame winners: Ralph Guldahl in 1937, Hogan in 1951 and Gene Littler in 1961. It has not hosted an Open since 1996, though Padraig Harrington won the P.G.A. there in 2008. The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., also had three Opens, each won by a Hall of Famer. Francis Ouimet, who lived across the street from the 17th tee, was 20 when he stunned the British icons Harry Vardon and Ted Ray in their historic 1913 playoff. Julius Boros won a playoff with Palmer and Jacky Cupit in 1963, and Strange won a playoff with Nick Faldo in 1988. Photo The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., had its first prominent winner in 1913 when Francis Ouimet, center, defeated the British stars Harry Vardon, left, and Ted Ray. Credit Associated Press Congressional, outside the nation’s capital, was the Open site for two Hall of Famers, Ken Venturi in 1964 and Els in 1997. When it returned as an Open host in 2011, Rory McIlroy breezed to an eight-stroke victory for the first of his four major titles. A victory this weekend by McIlroy, now ranked No. 1, would most likely validate Chambers Bay’s future. In 2017, the U.S.G.A. will audition another new course, Erin Hills, not far from Milwaukee. But next year, the Open will be at its old reliable, Oakmont, where the best golfers rise to the top.

      "text": " TOKYO — With President Obama’s trade agenda in jeopardy in Congress, the nations of Asia are weighing the potential impact of a failed deal on local jobs and exports but also something else: American influence in the region.\nFor many here, the defeat of a sweeping trade and investment pact being negotiated between the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations would weaken Washington’s already strained claim to leadership in Asia and undermine a commitment by Mr. Obama to devote more attention and resources to a group of countries contending with the growing power of China.\nCongress rejected legislation on Friday that is crucial to completing the trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, throwing its future — and its potential to bind together countries friendly to American interests — in doubt.\n Related Coverage House Republicans and White House Try to Revive Trade Bill Stalled by Democrats JUNE 15, 2015 Debate That Divides: What You Should Know About the Trans-Pacific Partnership JUNE 12, 2015 “If this collapses, Pacific Rim countries will be aghast,” said Shunpei Takemori, a professor at Keio University in Japan, the largest economy in the would-be trade zone after the United States. “China is pushing, and if the U.S. just stands aside, it would be a tragedy.”\nPhoto Workers harvesting lychees in Luc Ngan, Vietnam. President Obama argues that a Pacific Rim trade pact would require the Vietnamese government to improve employee safety. Credit Luong Thai Linh/European Pressphoto Agency The White House and its Republican free-trade allies in Congress are searching for ways to revive a bill that would extend aid to workers displaced by global trade agreements. By rejecting that measure on Friday, Mr. Obama’s fellow Democrats in the House effectively scuttled legislation granting him the power to negotiate trade deals that cannot be amended or filibustered by Congress.\nWithout such trade promotion authority, analysts in the region said, it may be impossible for Mr. Obama to persuade governments to make the concessions needed to close a deal that would affect 40 percent of the global economy.\nThe death of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be a new setback for American economic diplomacy in Asia after a failed attempt to thwart a Chinese state-run infrastructure investment fund that some see as a competitor to American-dominated institutions like the World Bank. The Obama administration has also struggled to respond to blunter assertions of Chinese power, such as Beijing’s efforts to strengthen its territorial claims by building islands out of reefs in the South China Sea.\nAdvertisement\n “If you don’t do this deal, what are your levers of power?” Singapore’s foreign minister, K. Shanmugam, said in Washington on Monday. “The choice is a very stark one: Do you want to be part of the region, or do you want to be out of the region?”\nHe argued that “trade is strategy” and that without economic leverage, the United States was left with only military clout in Asia “and that’s not the lever you want to use.”\n“It’s absolutely vital to get it done,” he added, referring to the bill’s passage.\nIn Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has presented the imperiled trade pact as key to his nation’s ambitions, and he has pushed back with unusual vigor for a Japanese leader against the country’s influential farm lobby, which has long opposed lower barriers to imports of rice and other agricultural products. He has made the case that Japan needs trade liberalization to bolster its stagnant economy, but his arguments have been as much about diplomacy as economics.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n “It is also about our security,” he said of the proposed trade deal in a speech during a joint session of Congress in April. “Long-term, its strategic value is awesome.”\nIchiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to the United States, described the Trans-Pacific Partnership as “economic glue to cement ties with like-minded countries,” including emerging economies such as Vietnam that are only partly integrated into the global economic order shaped by the United States.\n“It’s an important time for rule-making in Asia, and T.P.P. is central to establishing the right rules,” Mr. Fujisaki said. “I trust that Congress will ultimately understand that.”\nChina is conspicuously absent from the list of 12 countries negotiating the agreement. The group comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand and Peru, as well as Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. But the Chinese government has taken pains not to criticize the deal, and has even suggested it may eventually ask to join.\nBut for now, the pact’s wide-ranging rules on intellectual property, investor protections and workers’ rights are seen as a step too far for the ruling Communist Party.\n“China knows that T.P.P. is one of the pillars of U.S. rebalancing strategy in the Asia Pacific, and it is trying to create a club that excludes China,” said Song Guoyou, a professor at the Center for American Studies in Fudan University in Shanghai. The collapse of the deal, he added, would be “a huge blow to Obama’s effort to build an integrated trade system” in the Asia-Pacific region.\nProfessor Song said that the United States should work with China to offer a “more ambitious and more inclusive” agreement, and held up as an alternative a separate, less comprehensive regional trade deal that China is negotiating with countries in Southeast Asia as well as Japan, South Korea and other nations.\nNegotiations over that pact could gain momentum if the agreement fails, as could potential bilateral deals, including one proposed between Japan and the European Union that Tokyo deferred while it focused on the trade deal.\nSouth Korea, a crucial American ally and one of China’s top trading partners, has expressed interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks, but its enthusiasm has been muted. Some have accused the government of trying to use the Chinese proposal to secure better terms from the United States. A bilateral trade agreement with the United States that came into force in 2012 set off large, prolonged protests, and the South Korean government has been wary of entering another grueling round of politically charged trade talks with Washington.\nIn terms of tangible economic benefits, the stakes are higher for some nations than others. Countries like Australia and Singapore already have highly open markets and bilateral trade deals with many of their important trading partners, meaning the potential for additional gains is relatively small, experts said.\nAt the other extreme is Vietnam, the only Communist country in the group and perhaps its most incongruous member. Vietnam has played an outsize role in the debate over the deal in the United States, with Mr. Obama arguing that the Vietnamese government would be required to improve worker safety and allow the establishment of independent labor unions, something it currently forbids. Opponents of the pact countered that provisions on labor standards in trade deals were too difficult to enforce to make a difference.\nIn Japan, the failure of the Trans-Pacific Partnership could set back Mr. Abe’s efforts to open up the agricultural sector and other protected industries.\nJapanese trade negotiators had sought to preserve import barriers on some of the nation’s most sensitive farm products, including rice — a battle that had been the biggest obstacle to a deal until the House Democrats revolted. Japan was nonetheless preparing for painful concessions.\nA collapse in the talks could thus offer a political silver lining for Mr. Abe, who could avoid angering farmers and the rural members of his party who depend on their votes.\n“He has tackled some structural reform, but it has been rather piecemeal,” Professor Takemori of Keio said. “The agricultural lobby would have been furious.”",

But Macquarie and the private equity firms are struggling to find value in a diverse spread of businesses that have neither the scale nor potential margins that would make them eager buyers, said the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The lukewarm interest in the commercial business contrasts with the fiercely competitive auction for G.E.’s consumer lending business in Australia and New Zealand. Varde Partners, K.K.R. and Deutsche Bank agreed in March to pay $6.3 billion for the business, beating out, among others, TPG, Macquarie and Apollo Global Management. One investment banker who has done a preliminary analysis of GE Capital’s lending and leasing businesses said the private equity firms might find it difficult to put together a funding package to buy such a diverse mix of businesses, some of which are small, have few customers and are managed by just a few people. In an effort to keep the private equity giants interested, Morgan Stanley has not instituted a strict timetable of when preliminary bids must be submitted. GE Capital, Morgan Stanley, Blackstone, K.K.R., TPG and Macquarie either declined to comment or did not return calls seeking comment.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Donald J. Trump , the garrulous real estate developer whose name has adorned apartment buildings, hotels, Trump-brand neckties and Trump-brand steaks, announced on Tuesday his entry into the 2016 presidential race, brandishing his wealth and fame as chief qualifications in an improbable quest for the Republican nomination. Mr. Trump declared his candidacy in the atrium of Trump Tower, the luxury skyscraper on Fifth Avenue in New York City, saying, “We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.” Proclaiming that he will be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created,” he said he will restore America’s economic primacy as he repeatedly assailed the behavior of China. Mr. Trump, 69, has long toyed with running for president, boasting of his credentials as an entrepreneur and mocking the accomplishments of prominent elected officials. He has used the platform of a reality television show, NBC’s “The Apprentice,” to burnish his pop-culture image as a formidable man of affairs. Who Is Running for President (and Who’s Not)? It seems a remote prospect that Republicans, stung in 2012 by the caricature of their nominee, Mitt Romney, as a pampered and politically tone-deaf financier, would rebound by nominating a real estate magnate who has published books with titles such as, “Think Like a Billionaire” and “Midas Touch: Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich — And Why Most Don’t.” But Mr. Trump, who has never held elected office, may not be so easily confined to the margins of the 2016 campaign. Thanks to his enormous media profile, he stands a good chance of qualifying for nationally televised debates, where his appetite for combat and skill at playing to the gallery could make him a powerfully disruptive presence. In the past, Mr. Trump’s presidential posturing has seldom been taken seriously, and for good reason: Ahead of the 2000 and 2012 elections, Mr. Trump twice hyped up the possibility of seeking the White House before abandoning the idea. And this time, there is widespread suspicion that he is entering the race just to appear in the debates. Mr. Trump and his allies insist that he is serious about this race. He intends to release a financial statement sketching out his net worth in broad, perhaps generous terms, although it is unclear whether he will make a more complete disclosure of tax returns as required of candidates. Associates say Mr. Trump is willing, even eager, to spend his fortune in the race, and has hired staff in the early nominating states. “He has said a couple of times that he could easily put $100 million into the race and that he feels that would not impact him financially,” said Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Ruddy, who is chief executive of Newsmax, the conservative magazine and website, said Mr. Trump would bring an unaccustomed level of glamour to the Republican field. “He’s got that celebrity status,” Mr. Ruddy said. “Republicans sort of crave that, because we don’t have it, generally.” \nAdvertisement",

      "text": "JUNE 14, 2015 The officials did not say which employees were the focus of the investigation or whether the team’s highest-ranking officials were aware of the hacking or authorized it. The investigation is being led by the F.B.I. ’s Houston field office and has progressed to the point that subpoenas have been served on the Cardinals and Major League Baseball for electronic correspondence. Photo The Houston Astros hired Luhnow as general manager in December 2011. Before then he had been a successful and polarizing executive with the Cardinals. Credit David J. Phillip/Associated Press The attack represents the first known case of corporate espionage in which a professional sports team has hacked the network of another team. Illegal intrusions into companies’ networks have become commonplace, but it is generally conducted by hackers operating in foreign countries, like Russia and China, who steal large tranches of data or trade secrets for military equipment and electronics. Major League Baseball “has been aware of and has fully cooperated with the federal investigation into the illegal breach of the Astros’ baseball operations database,” a spokesman for baseball’s commissioner, Rob Manfred, said in a written statement. The Cardinals officials under investigation have not been put on leave, suspended or fired. The commissioner’s office is likely to wait until the conclusion of the government’s investigation to determine whether to take disciplinary action against the officials or the team. The case is a rare mark of ignominy for the Cardinals, one of the sport’s most revered and popular organizations. The team has the best record in baseball this season (42-21), regularly commands outsize television ratings and has reached the National League Championship Series nine times since 2000. The Cardinals, who last won the World Series in 2011, have 11 titles over all, second only to the Yankees. Their owner, Bill DeWitt, is a highly regarded executive who last year was in charge of the search committee for a new commissioner to replace the retiring Bud Selig. Law enforcement officials believe the hacking was executed by vengeful front-office employees for the Cardinals hoping to wreak havoc on the work of Jeff Luhnow, the Astros’ general manager who had been a successful and polarizing executive with the Cardinals until 2011. From 1994 to 2012, the Astros and the Cardinals were division rivals, in the National League. For a part of that time, Mr. Luhnow was a Cardinals executive, primarily handling scouting and player development. One of many innovative thinkers drawn to the sport by the “Moneyball” phenomenon, he was credited with building baseball’s best minor league system, as well as drafting several players who would become linchpins of the Cardinals’ 2011 World Series-winning team. \nAdvertisement",

      "title": "Study Supports Antibiotic Use to Treat Appendicitis",
      "text": "Continue reading the main story For more than 100 years, the standard treatment for appendicitis has been surgery. Now a large Finnish study provides the best evidence to date that most patients can be treated with antibiotics alone. The study , published Tuesday in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, involved 530 patients aged 18 to 60 who agreed to have their treatment — antibiotics or surgery — decided at random. Three out of four who took antibiotics recovered easily, the researchers found: the pain vanished, and they went on with their lives. And none who had surgery after taking antibiotics was worse off for having waited. “The time has come to consider abandoning routine appendectomy for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, ” Dr. Edward H. Livingston, a surgeon and editor at the journal, who was not involved with the study, wrote in an editorial accompanying the report . The study comes amid growing questions about the routine use of surgery to treat appendicitis, which strikes about 300,000 Americans a year, afflicting one out of 10 adults at some point in their lives. The new results only apply to uncomplicated appendicitis, stressed Dr. Paulina Salminen, a surgeon at Turku University Hospital in Finland and lead author of the new study. She and her colleagues excluded the 20 percent of patients with complicated cases — people with perforated appendices or abdominal abscesses, and those with a little, rock-like blockage of the appendix called an appendicolith. To distinguish the complicated from the uncomplicated cases, the Finnish doctors used CT scans, which, Dr. Livingston said, are “almost perfect for diagnosis.” But Dr. Philip S. Barie, a surgeon at Weill Cornell Medical College, noted that antibiotics were not sufficient for more than a quarter of the patients in the new study and said the failure rate was unacceptable. Patients should have the simple and safe operation to remove their appendix, he said, taking care of the problem quickly and permanently. Dr. Livingston disagreed. When he saw the results, he said in an interview, his first thought was, “Wow. I’ve been waiting for this.” Dr. Livingston began wondering about the role of surgery 10 years ago when he operated on a young man with appendicitis who experienced a rocky recovery. The case prompted him to review the medical literature. He found that much of the original research was done by a surgeon, Dr. Reginald H. Fitz, who in 1886 investigated why people die from pelvic infections. Dr. Fitz looked at autopsy reports and found many patients whose appendices had been inflamed. That led him to conclude that the appendix may become injured, then infected, then gangrenous; finally, he theorized, a lethal infection spreads through the pelvis. The way to prevent this dire chain of events, Dr. Fitz decided, was to remove the appendix. But more recent research has shown that the infected appendix does not become “gangrenous,” and, as even Dr. Fitz noticed, some patients simply get better on their own. \nAdvertisement",

He is trying to learn as much as he can from watching the pros before returning to the junior golf circuit and his Houston high school, where he will be a sophomore in the fall.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage From Tree to Greens, a U.S. Open Unlike Any Before JUNE 12, 2015 Sports of The Times: Best U.S. Open Courses Give Players a Lift, and Vice Versa JUNE 15, 2015 TV Sports: Is the U.S. Open Ready for the Fox Era?

On the 18th hole, someone from the stands yelled out, “Hammer!,” and Hammer’s face reddened. From years of watching the pros, he knew what to do. He looked in the man’s direction and doffed his cap.\n“It’s pretty surreal,” Hammer said of being recognized. “It’s really cool.”\nHammer is so young, he barely shaves — “a little bit, sometimes,” he said sheepishly — and he cannot drive the courtesy car that he received the keys to when he registered for the tournament. He has his learning permit and is looking forward to obtaining his license after he turns 16 in August.\n“I kind of want to get it so I can take myself places,” Hammer said. “Go to the golf course when I want to and stuff like that.”\nHammer’s father, Gregg, was carrying his bag Monday and will be his caddie when the tournament starts Thursday. Both of Hammer’s parents have won club championships at River Oaks, and Hammer, who followed them into the game when he was a toddler, has caddied for them.\nWas there any doubt his father would be riding shotgun for Hammer’s United States Open debut?\n“Not if he wanted to eat,” the elder Hammer said with a laugh. “No, I’m kidding. It was totally up to him. I struggled with it a little bit because I didn’t want to do him a disservice by being his caddie without knowing anything about the course.”\nAfter playing 54 practice holes, both Hammers feel more at ease in their surroundings.\nPhoto “I think it’s amazing that he’s here,” said Spieth, left, the reigning Masters champion, who was pared with Hammer during Wednesday's practice round. “He’s had a smile on his face every moment that I’ve seen him.” Credit John David Mercer/USA Today Sports, via Reuters “This has been an amazing experience for both of us so far,” Gregg Hammer said. His son, he added, “seems to be handling everything O.K.

The top two spots in the world rankings are occupied by Rory McIlroy, 26, and Spieth.\n“He’s so good,” Hammer said of Spieth. “Definitely one of my role models.”\nHammer had hoped to one day play against McIlroy and Spieth. He never expected that day to come this week. On Monday he practiced next to Spieth on the range. On Tuesday, he looked up and there was McIlroy hitting balls.\n“He hits it so far it’s crazy,” Hammer said during a Tuesday morning news conference that began with him turning to the moderator and whispering, “Do I just sit here and talk?”\nHammer said he entered qualifying as a lark.\n“I just thought it would be cool to try, to see where it would take me,” he said, adding, “Just looking for a good experience to see how my game compared to others.”\nSpieth said he was excited to see how Hammer plays this week.\n“He’s getting better experience than I had at his age,” Spieth said. He added, “It’s cool that these young junior golfers are looking to us young guys on Tour and working their tails off to get here.”\nLoading...

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story KHON KAEN, Thailand — Thailand hasn’t had as many coups and constitutions as, say, the Dominican Republic or Venezuela, but it outdoes them for fastest turnover: The average lifespan of a Thai constitution is a bit more than four years.\nIn May of last year , after months of street protests, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha and other senior military officials overthrew the elected government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. And the junta, following that hallowed tradition of Thai coup-makers, promptly abolished the country’s 18th “permanent” constitution.\nIt proposed a new one in April. Supposedly the centerpiece of the regime’s roadmap to “sustainable democracy,” the draft constitution is a major step backward. And the junta’s recent announcement that the text will be put to a popular referendum seems like a badly concealed ploy to extend its time in power, since holding the referendum means postponing general elections until at least August or September 2016.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Yingluck Shinawatra Pleads Not Guilty to Negligence Over Thai Rice Subsidy MAY 19, 2015 With every attempt to justify its tenure, the junta undercuts its legitimacy.\nThe draft constitution weakens political parties. It proposes that the Senate be largely appointed. It allows for an unelected prime minister. The section entitled “Good Leaderships and Desirable Political System” forbids anyone in office from exercising “powers and duties to establish political popularity which may be detrimental to the national economic system or the public in the long run.”\nThe text also creates an array of mechanisms and watchdog bodies that could remove elected politicians. Most prominent and problematic is the National Moral Assembly: Composed mostly of appointed officials, it could start impeachment investigations under a Code of Ethics that has yet to be specified.\nContinue reading the main story Related in Opinion Editorial: Trickery and False Promises in Thailand APRIL 10, 2015 General Prayuth’s constitution, despite including buzzwords like “participation,” “accountabilities” and “sustainable fairness,” will only glue into place an undemocratic political system and philosophy. The draft is a step down from the 2007 constitution, which itself was a step down from the 1997 constitution — the so-called people’s constitution and arguably Thailand’s most democratic to date.\nMost of the 1997 charter’s drafters had been elected. Its text was subjected to a thorough public consultation. It included extensive, and unprecedented, protections for political and social rights. And it provided for a stronger executive and stronger political parties, and for checks and balances.\nThe 1997 constitution may have been a bit too democratic, actually, at least for the traditional elites in Bangkok: big business owners, ultraconservative royalists and high-ranking military and government officials. Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecoms magnate and provincial politician, was elected prime minister in 2001 on a populist platform promoting universal health care, agricultural subsidies and access to capital in rural areas. He won the allegiance of farmers, laborers and the poor, mostly in the populous north and northeast, and instilled in them an appetite for democratic values and constitutional order.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The Bangkok elites, alleging that the Thaksin government was corrupt and had monopolized power, staged a coup against him in 2006. They put together a new constitution , which, by scaling back on democratic freedoms, was supposed to prevent the return of populist undesirables to power. But the years since have followed the same pattern, with pro-Thaksin parties repeatedly winning elections and the Bangkok elites repeatedly arranging for their removal, either through the courts or the military.\nAlmost as soon as General Prayuth and his junta ousted Ms. Yingluck last year, it seemed clear that they intended to stay put for a long while. Virtually all their appointees to the National Legislative Assembly, the National Reform Council and the Constitution Drafting Committee are ultraconservative Bangkok-based bureaucrats, generals, academics and businesspeople. And the entire constitution-drafting exercise looks like an elaborate delaying tactic designed to keep those people in place.\nLate last year, under pressure from both foreign governments and Thai political parties, the junta unveiled a roadmap for reforms, including plans for a new constitution, leading up to a general election in February 2016. But then the draft came. Predictably, that text was widely decried, not only by pro-Thaksin and pro-democracy groups, but by political parties of all stripes. And just as predictably, the parties that had been clamoring for an election suddenly stopped: Anything was better than seeing this constitution implemented.\nThe junta then played coy about holding a referendum: It balked at the idea at first, only to relent as though it were responding to public opinion. Except, of course, that organizing a referendum requires postponing the election, and as long as the election is postponed, the junta stays in power.\nThis is a dangerous game. For one thing, Thais might vote down the constitution in a referendum. The only other time such a plebiscite was held was in 2007; the people have seen what little good came from their voting yes then; and the current draft is even less democratic than that one was. A no vote would be a severe rebuke for the junta, an indictment of its coup and a major loss of legitimacy — reason enough for General Prayuth to step down.\nBut would he? Why? What was this coup all about, anyway? It certainly was not about democracy. Rather, it was about putting in place a system to keep Thaksin & Co. out of power. Mr. Thaksin represents the other Thailand, the Thailand of the countryside, and traditionalists see him as an usurper. King Bhumibol Adulyadej is often portrayed as a monarch of the people, and dedicated to the poor. Mr. Thaksin took his place, in effect, shaking the foundations of the Thai state’s sense of identity.\nIn a kind of conservative reflex, General Prayuth and the traditional elites are now turning to the monarchy to reclaim legitimacy. They have redoubled efforts to root out people they perceive as threats to the royal family, invoking the country’s very strict lèse-majesté laws to imprison dissenters for unimaginably long terms, often over trifling statements. Who will succeed Bhumibol, 87 and ailing, is of ultimate concern to the junta.\nYet it is a concern that only betrays just how out of touch with the new Thailand the generals are. They still think the monarchy is the country’s ultimate unifying symbol, even though its influence has been declining since the mid-2000s.\nThere was a time when a Thai military junta could overthrow an elected government, tear up the constitution, get a court to legitimize its coup, receive the throne’s blessing, write up a new constitution, grant itself an amnesty for all its troubles, and call it a day. Not anymore.\nDavid Streckfuss is the author of “Truth on Trial in Thailand: Defamation, Treason, and Lèse-Majesté.”",

      "text": "The Broad collection is perpetually growing — the philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad are known to average one acquisition a week. But now, as the collection prepares to open its new contemporary art museum downtown in Los Angeles on Sept. 20, the Broads have picked up the pace.\nOn Tuesday, the collection announced that it had added more than 50 artworks by newer artists like Julie Mehretu , Goshka Macuga and Ella Kruglyanskaya, and established artists like John Baldessari, Ed Ruscha, Jeff Koons, Christopher Wool and Damien Hirst.\nThe acquisitions also include a massive work by Takashi Murakami, which is the largest painting in the Broad collection; a 1954 combine by Robert Rauschenberg; and three sculptures by Cy Twombly.\nMost of the additions have been acquired within a year of their production. Still unclear is which pieces will be included in the museum’s inaugural show. That exhibition is to feature some 250 of the collection’s works, and will be organized by Joanne Heyler , the Broad’s director.\n“People sometimes ask whether Edye and I ever get tired of pursuing new acquisitions,” Mr. Broad said in a statement. “It’s like asking if we’re tired of life. It’s exciting to discover new works — as they’re being created. We were drawn to contemporary art because it’s art of our time. And these latest acquisitions represent the themes and issues of the world we live in today.”",

      "text": "JAN. 30, 2015 Mr. Trump claimed last month that he had devised a “foolproof way” to defeat the Islamic State “very quickly.” But he refused to divulge it, saying he did not “want the enemy to know what I’m doing.” He calls President Obama “one of the worst things that’s ever happened to Israel,” and blames him for deteriorating U.S.-Israeli relations. He says Russian-backed separatists are acting aggressively in Ukraine because the United States is “not a respected country and we don’t have respected leadership at this moment” – but says America’s European allies should confront Russia. Immigration Mr. Trump – whose mother emigrated from Scotland – says illegal immigrants are “destroying the fabric of the country” while the middle class is getting “decimated.”. He opposes efforts to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants, calling that a “suicide mission” for Republicans because “every one of those 11 million people will be voting Democratic.” He proposes instead to fortify the nation’s borders by building “a real wall” to keep immigrants out. Same-Sex Marriage Mr. Trump says that his views on marriage are “evolving” but that he still favors “traditional marriage,” between “a man and a woman.” (He has been married three times.) Same-sex marriage , he says, isn’t his “thing.” Environment He does not just deny that climate change is occurring; he calls it a hoax, and says those who warn of global warming only want to raise taxes. He is less outspoken on other environmental issues, though he sued unsuccessfully in 2013 to block plans for wind turbines in Scotland that would power 65,000 homes, arguing, in part, that they would mar the view from a golf course he was proposing to build. Economy and Budget Mr. Trump believes reckless government borrowing and stimulative policies by the Federal Reserve threaten the long-term health of the American economy and undermine the dollar, which, he said in 2012, “is going to go to hell.” He strongly opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, calling it “an attack on America’s business” that fails to penalize Asian nations like Japan when, he says, they engage in currency manipulation to boost exports. He takes particular aim at China, accusing it of currency manipulation and flooding the United States with low-cost exports that “are truly hurting our economy and our jobs” – including, as it turns out, products with the Trump label . He attacked Mr. Obama last year for visiting China and “celebrating the fact that they’re ripping us off.” \nFollow The New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .

      "text": " It might seem a bit like a crooked politician breaking into the office of a rival who is at 2 percent in the polls, or a master spy choosing to snoop around the embassy of Tonga.\nFederal investigators suspect that front office personnel of the St. Louis Cardinals hacked into the computer systems of a rival major league baseball team.\nIf the account is true, the team they chose was the Houston Astros , one of the worst in baseball for years.\nWhat would be the motivation for a phenomenally successful team like the Cardinals poking around the databases of a perennial loser?\nThe answer appears to be Jeff Luhnow.\nLuhnow was part of the wave of “Moneyball”-style executives who revolutionized baseball front offices at the start of the century.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Cardinals Face F.B.I. Inquiry in Hacking of Astros’ Network JUNE 16, 2015 A Penn and Northwestern graduate who had worked in consulting, he joined the Cardinals in 2003 despite having no baseball experience. After facing some initial skepticism, he started hitting home runs. He oversaw the team’s draft beginning in 2005 and showed an uncanny knack for finding talent.\nAmong the eventual major leaguers he drafted in his first three years were Colby Rasmus, Allen Craig, Daniel Descalso, Jaime Garcia, Jon Jay, Luke Gregerson and Chris Perez. From 2005 through 2007 St. Louis drafted 24 players who were major leaguers by 2011, the most of any team.\nIn the years that followed he drafted Matt Carpenter, Trevor Rosenthal, Matt Adams, Lance Lynn, Kolten Wong and many others.\nLuhnow’s international signings included pitchers Fernando Salas of Mexico and Eduardo Sanchez of Venezuela. The Cardinals played in three World Series and won two in his years there.\nBut in December 2011 he left the Cards for a promotion to general manager of the Astros, at that time a division rival and the worst team in baseball. Luhnow brought along Sig Mejdal, a former NASA engineer; his title is director for decision sciences. Mejdal applied work he had done at NASA on astronauts’ decision making to improve the team’s drafting.\nIt is not know for sure what motivated the hacking that is alleged. Anger over Luhnow’s departure, or lingering bitterness over his time in St. Louis, where he was a polarizing figure, may have been a cause. Law enforcement officials say that the Cardinals could have suspected that Luhnow had taken proprietary information with him to Houston.\nBut the goal might also have been access to Ground Control, a vast database of Luhnow’s unquestioned baseball knowledge.\nSince going to the Astros, Luhnow has used the team’s high draft picks to take the top prospects Mark Appel, a pitcher, and Carlos Correa, a shortstop.\nHe also cut the payroll drastically, leading to the team’s having abysmal seasons in 2012 and 2013. But in 2014 the Astros climbed back to respectability and in 2015 completed an amazing turnaround by leading their division.\nThings are looking up for baseball fans in Houston. And that seems to have attracted the attention of even a team as successful as the Cardinals.\nLoading...

      "text": " LONDON — Australian trailblazer Nick Kyrgios lasted just 49 minutes against Stanislas Wawrinka at Queen's Club on Tuesday before saying he wanted to forget all about tennis in the run-up to Wimbledon.\n\"Probably going to stay in my house for a couple of days and sleep, play computer games and chill out,\" the 20-year-old told reporters after losing 6-3 6-4 on his debut at the Aegon Championships, the traditional pre-Wimbledon warm-up event.\n\"Just not think about tennis, turn off all tennis channels, delete my ATP app and just not think about tennis for a week.\"\nIt was all a far cry from 12 months ago when he blew Rafa Nadal off court at Wimbledon and reached the quarter-finals on his debut at the grasscourt grand slam.\nSporting a bleached white stripe on the side of his head, Kyrgios served up the odd missile but looked distracted as he was easily beaten by the French Open champion.\nAt times he looked as though he was going through the motions and after Wawrinka sealed victory with an ace, Kyrgios was off court in a flash and was in the media interview room minutes later, clearly in a hurry to leave.\nHe said he had not been feeling well since the French Open where he lost to Andy Murray in the third round.\nLast week Kyrgios was forced to pull out of the Den Bosch grasscourt event in the Netherlands with an elbow injury and, despite the Australian-like sunshine on Tuesday, he looked as though he would rather have been somewhere else.\n\"I just felt uncomfortable the whole time, not feeling great,\" the world number 28 said. \"I almost found it difficult to get myself engaged and didn't want to be there.\"\nA friend from home will fly in soon and his father will arrive for Wimbledon, Kyrgios added before admitting the long stretch of European tennis was proving difficult.\n\"I have been battling mentally a bit,\" he said. \"We will see how it goes. It's tough at the moment.\"\nDespite the gloomy outlook Kyrgios believes he can make a big impression at Wimbledon where his dream run was ended last year by Canada's Milos Raonic.\n\"I feel confident still. I know I could do some good things there and I know I don't necessarily need too many matches before grand slams,\" he said.\n\"I just need to chill out for a couple of days... I'm pretty tired.\"\n(Editing by Tony Jimenez)\n ",

Dolezal, who resigned as president of the N.A.A.C.P. chapter in Spokane, Wash., has been accused of misrepresenting her racial background. A look at how she’s identified herself. Publish Date June 16, 2015. Photo by Colin Mulvany/The Spokesman-Review, via Associated Press. She traced misconceptions about her background to local news media reports that first identified her as “transracial,” then as biracial and then as black. “I never corrected that,” she said — even as she insisted that there was nothing to correct. In fact, her role has not been so passive — she has identified herself as black or partly black on many occasions, including on an application for appointment to a Spokane city commission, where she checked boxes for white, black and Native American. In the “Today” interview, Ms. Dolezal defended publicly identifying a black friend, who is not a relative, as her father. “We connected on a very intimate level as family,” she said. “Albert Wilkerson is my dad.” Several years ago, she became the guardian of one of her adopted, black younger siblings, Izaiah, now 21. He sees her as his “real mom,” she said, “and for that to be something that is plausible, I certainly can’t be seen as white and be Izaiah’s mom.” She also has a biological son, who is 13, with her former husband, who is black. In the MSNBC interview, Ms. Dolezal said, “I have really gone there with the experience, in terms of the being a mother of two black sons, and really owning what it means to experience and live blackness.”",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story In March, at the actual argument of the King case, Justice Scalia did not seem much taken by the administration’s position. Instead, he said Congress was free to fix the law if the law said something other than what had been intended. “You really think Congress is just going to sit there while all of these disastrous consequences ensue?” Justice Scalia asked. “Congress adjusts, enacts a statute that takes care of the problem. It happens all the time. Why is that not going to happen here?” The administration’s lawyer, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., all but rolled his eyes. “This Congress?” he asked, and the courtroom erupted in knowing laughter. If the administration does not capture Justice Scalia’s vote, it will hope that either Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. or Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joins the court’s four more liberal members to uphold the subsidies. But in a congressional budget hearing a few weeks after the argument, Justice Kennedy sounded like Justice Scalia. “We routinely decide cases involving federal statutes and we say, ‘Well, if this is wrong, the Congress will fix it,’” he said. The court, he said, should not let the state of Congress affect its decisions. “We have to assume that we have three fully functioning branches of the government,” he said. Eric J. Segall, a law professor at Georgia State University, had this reaction on Twitter: “Justice Kennedy basically just announced how he will vote in King and news not good.” If he is right, the fate of the law may rest with Chief Justice Roberts. The week before the argument in the King case, he joined an opinion from Justice Ginsburg . The case was a trifle that asked whether the destruction of a fish violated the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a federal law mainly meant to combat financial crimes. The court ruled for the fisherman based on what Justice Ginsburg called “the broader context of the statute as a whole.” Noah Feldman, a law professor at Harvard, said this was notable. “Reading the tea leaves — or maybe the fish entrails — it’s possible to get some clues about how the court will interpret” the health care law, Professor Feldman wrote in a column for Bloomberg View. It was telling, he said, that “Roberts was willing to join the liberals to read a statute according to context.” Justice Ginsburg, who knows how the justices voted in the new health care case, dropped no hint on Saturday about how it would turn out. Or perhaps, as happened three years ago, she did and we all missed it.

      "text": " Donald J. Trump , the garrulous real estate developer whose name has adorned apartment buildings, hotels, Trump-brand neckties and Trump-brand steaks, announced on Tuesday his entry into the 2016 presidential race, brandishing his wealth and fame as chief qualifications in an improbable quest for the Republican nomination.\nMr. Trump declared his candidacy in the atrium of Trump Tower, the luxury skyscraper on Fifth Avenue in New York City, saying, “We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again.” Proclaiming that he will be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created,” he said he will restore America’s economic primacy as he repeatedly assailed the behavior of China.\n Donald Trump on the Issues JUNE 16, 2015 Mr. Trump, 69, has long toyed with running for president, boasting of his credentials as an entrepreneur and mocking the accomplishments of prominent elected officials. He has used the platform of a reality television show, NBC’s “The Apprentice,” to burnish his pop-culture image as a formidable man of affairs.\nContinue reading the main story Who Is Running for President (and Who’s Not)? It seems a remote prospect that Republicans, stung in 2012 by the caricature of their nominee, Mitt Romney, as a pampered and politically tone-deaf financier, would rebound by nominating a real estate magnate who has published books with titles such as, “Think Like a Billionaire” and “Midas Touch: Why Some Entrepreneurs Get Rich — And Why Most Don’t.”\nBut Mr. Trump, who has never held elected office, may not be so easily confined to the margins of the 2016 campaign. Thanks to his enormous media profile, he stands a good chance of qualifying for nationally televised debates, where his appetite for combat and skill at playing to the gallery could make him a powerfully disruptive presence.\nIn the past, Mr. Trump’s presidential posturing has seldom been taken seriously, and for good reason: Ahead of the 2000 and 2012 elections, Mr. Trump twice hyped up the possibility of seeking the White House before abandoning the idea. And this time, there is widespread suspicion that he is entering the race just to appear in the debates.\nMr. Trump and his allies insist that he is serious about this race. He intends to release a financial statement sketching out his net worth in broad, perhaps generous terms, although it is unclear whether he will make a more complete disclosure of tax returns as required of candidates. Associates say Mr. Trump is willing, even eager, to spend his fortune in the race, and has hired staff in the early nominating states.\n“He has said a couple of times that he could easily put $100 million into the race and that he feels that would not impact him financially,” said Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Mr. Trump’s.\nMr. Ruddy, who is chief executive of Newsmax, the conservative magazine and website, said Mr. Trump would bring an unaccustomed level of glamour to the Republican field.\n“He’s got that celebrity status,” Mr. Ruddy said. “Republicans sort of crave that, because we don’t have it, generally.”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Geraldo Rivera, the veteran broadcaster who was a finalist on the reality show “Celebrity Apprentice,” said Mr. Trump would quickly leave a mark on the race thanks to his ability as a showman.\nContinue reading the main story Political News, Now. “Right now, Jeb Bush is announcing,” Mr. Rivera said Monday afternoon. “Who would you rather watch, him or Trump?”\nBut as well known as he is, Mr. Trump is also widely disliked: A recent Quinnipiac University poll found that about seven in 10 voters nationally hold an unfavorable view of him, including 52 percent of Republicans.\nMr. Trump has shown he is eager to scuffle with other Republicans, including Mr. Bush. He has spoken contemptuously, in public and private, about the former Florida governor, as well as other candidates, such as Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive whose business credentials he has impugned.\n“The last thing we need right now,” Mr. Trump told ABC News in December, “is another Bush.”\nMr. Trump’s policy views can be just as provocative as his demeanor. He calls climate change “a hoax” and says he has a “foolproof” plan to defeat the Islamic State that he will not reveal so as not to tip off the group.\nBut until now, he may be best known politically for his outspoken skepticism that President Obama was born in the United States. After his insistent demands during the 2012 race that Mr. Obama release his birth certificate, the president ultimately did just that, confirming he was born in Hawaii.\nMr. Trump has donated money to both parties, including to Democrats such as Hillary Rodham Clinton. When Mr. Trump entertained a presidential bid in 2012, the conservative Club for Growth labeled him a liberal for his views on trade and his past support for universal health care, and accused him of having exploited government powers, including the use of eminent domain, to expand his real estate holdings.\nIf Mr. Trump’s ideology has proved flexible, the cornerstone of his worldview has not: He has consistently been a passionate believer in Donald Trump, and his own capacity to bully and badger his way into the best possible deal. That skill set, Mr. Trump has argued, would be an asset to America.\nIn a recent interview with The Des Moines Register, Mr. Trump described himself as “the most successful person ever to run” for president.\n“Ross Perot isn’t successful like me,” he told the Iowa newspaper. “Romney — I have a Gucci store that’s worth more than Romney.”",

      "text": "JAN. 30, 2015 Mr. Trump claimed last month that he had devised a “foolproof way” to defeat the Islamic State “very quickly.” But he refused to divulge it, saying he did not “want the enemy to know what I’m doing.” He calls President Obama “one of the worst things that’s ever happened to Israel,” and blames him for deteriorating U.S.-Israeli relations. He says Russian-backed separatists are acting aggressively in Ukraine because the United States is “not a respected country and we don’t have respected leadership at this moment” – but says America’s European allies should confront Russia. Immigration Mr. Trump – whose mother emigrated from Scotland – says illegal immigrants are “destroying the fabric of the country” while the middle class is getting “decimated.”. He opposes efforts to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants, calling that a “suicide mission” for Republicans because “every one of those 11 million people will be voting Democratic.” He proposes instead to fortify the nation’s borders by building “a real wall” to keep immigrants out. Same-Sex Marriage Mr. Trump says that his views on marriage are “evolving” but that he still favors “traditional marriage,” between “a man and a woman.” (He has been married three times.) Same-sex marriage , he says, isn’t his “thing.” Environment He does not just deny that climate change is occurring; he calls it a hoax, and says those who warn of global warming only want to raise taxes. He is less outspoken on other environmental issues, though he sued unsuccessfully in 2013 to block plans for wind turbines in Scotland that would power 65,000 homes, arguing, in part, that they would mar the view from a golf course he was proposing to build. Economy and Budget Mr. Trump believes reckless government borrowing and stimulative policies by the Federal Reserve threaten the long-term health of the American economy and undermine the dollar, which, he said in 2012, “is going to go to hell.” He strongly opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, calling it “an attack on America’s business” that fails to penalize Asian nations like Japan when, he says, they engage in currency manipulation to boost exports. He takes particular aim at China, accusing it of currency manipulation and flooding the United States with low-cost exports that “are truly hurting our economy and our jobs” – including, as it turns out, products with the Trump label . He attacked Mr. Obama last year for visiting China and “celebrating the fact that they’re ripping us off.” \nFollow The New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Even as some venues are moving out of the city, the site for tennis, for example, has been switched from Harvard into Boston, to an African-American club in Dorchester, a hardscrabble neighborhood that draws a diverse clientele. Spreading the wealth may help the bid pick up political support within Massachusetts, which expects to hold a statewide referendum next year on whether to host the Games. But some note that the broader field of play is at odds with the bid accepted by the United States Olympic Committee when it chose Boston as its host candidate over Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington in January. “This was a bait-and-switch,” said Chris Dempsey, a co-chairman for No Boston Olympics, the chief opposition group. He added: “They’re trying to appeal to a new reality, where they have to win a statewide referendum. The only way to do that is to start to sprinkle these things around.” And the end result, he said, will be to stick all taxpayers, not just those in Boston, with the tab for the inevitable cost overruns. After Sochi, Russia, spent $52 billion on the 2014 Winter Olympics, a dwindling number of cities were willing to compete to host the quadrennial extravaganza and deal with the usual litter of white elephants. The I.O.C. last year adopted what it called Agenda 2020, which suggested that future Games be less expensive, more compact and more sustainable, with identifiable long-term benefits for the hosts. Dick Pound, an I.O.C. delegate based in Montreal, said that moving some venues out of Boston would not necessarily hurt the city’s chances against other candidates, which include Rome; Hamburg, Germany; and probably Paris. “Massachusetts is not Texas, so you’re not talking huge distances,” Mr. Pound said. He noted that sailing events, for example, were typically held at some remove from the host city — and all the better if those venues provide world-class sailing waters, like those at Buzzards Bay. Mr. Pound also said the I.O.C. was not trying to impose a top-down “made in Switzerland” approach. “This is essentially a partnership,” he said. “It’s not good for you if you end up with a bunch of white elephants, and it’s not good for us to have unhappy host cities. Let’s see if we can get this done on a win-win basis. That’s the change of attitude since Agenda 2020.” Some have indicated that in the eyes of the I.O.C., a bigger problem for Boston than moving venues out of the city might be the sagging poll numbers; only 39 percent of statewide voters in the most recent poll supported hosting the Olympics, while 49 percent opposed it. Mr. Pound, the I.O.C. delegate, said that that could be a problem but that going out of Boston might improve those numbers. “It’s Boston’s meatloaf to make,” he said. “They’ve got to figure out what’s good for them. And it’s certainly fair to reconsider the original idea. As it was, it wasn’t getting much of a positive response.” Loading...",

      "text": "Photo Nike’s new showroom and fitness studio in SoHo, 45 Grand, opened this spring in a discreet location, formerly a metalwork shop. Rafael de Cárdenas and Jen Brill designed the space for the Nike Women brand. Credit Nicholas Knight In the fashion world, showrooms are essentially a safe place for editors, buyers and stylists of very important clients to experience a collection — to ask questions, inspect details, feel fabrics and understand a garment’s nuances. At certain showroom appointments, models are even on hand to help visitors visualize pieces on the wearer — how they move with the body or drape across it, which features they accentuate and what proportions they require. And at Nike’s newest showroom, 45 Grand (so named for its address), the goal is, similarly, to educate and provide an experience. But the interiors are nothing like what the industry has come to expect.\nPhoto From left: Alex Silver-Fagan, a 45 Grand trainer who also happens to be a Wilhelmina fitness model; on the main level of 45 Grand, a colorful, rounded wall obscures a view of workouts from the street. Credit Nicholas Knight When it opened last month in a discreet SoHo location with a workout space and by-invitation-only access, a few haters hated, calling it a fancy, exclusive fitness studio for the media elite. The only real evidence of its existence had been a slew of Instagrams with the #45grand hashtag, in which fashion editors — and of course Karlie Kloss (and, ahem, T Magazine ) — thank Nike for the sweat session, and show off their personalized lockers and sweaty bodies. But for Nike, which doesn’t produce a single item outside of the performance wear category, a showroom without a treadmill and gym floor would be a virtual disservice to its guests. How do you exhibit the breathability of a pair of tights if you don’t have the wearer sweat in them? Or the cushioned ride of a pair of shoes without sending laced-up feet on a run?\nPhoto De Cárdenas attributes much of the design of the pink upstairs lounge to Brill. Credit Nicholas Knight The two levels in what was once a metalwork shop were designed by Rafael de Cárdenas, the downtown (and perpetually in-demand) interior designer and founder of Architecture at Large , alongside the creative director Jen Brill, to celebrate the Nike Women brand specifically. “That was definitely the brief. I wouldn’t say we by any means ignored it, but we wanted to approach femininity in a tougher way. It’s for this kind of, like, tough girl,” says de Cárdenas, touching on the phrase “strong is the new skinny.” While the main-level fitness studio is gender neutral — black walls and steps surround a mostly modular gray floor — it’s the upstairs mezzanine-level lounge that really establishes the space as one created for the ladies. Soft pink tufted seating bends and wraps around a skylit room that could easily fit into a designer boutique or a high-end department store. But still, don’t call it “girly.” “I think it feels more chic to me, and kind of refined — and so in that sense, it speaks to femininity,” says de Cárdenas, who credits Brill as having given a lot of definition and life to the space.\nDe Cárdenas concedes that what you ultimately get at 45 Grand, in addition to the brand experience, is “a real intense workout.” He would know; the architect lives and works in the neighborhood and so finds time to sneak into a class here and there. “I don’t have the privilege of necessarily going to so many spaces that we work on because they’re kind of all over the world,” he says. “But it’s been really nice to be able to go back and see how things are getting used and how they’re getting personalized as the staff uses it, which is kind of an extension of how the trainers want to use things.”\nPhoto Like at other fashion showrooms, Nike highlights the latest merchandise at 45 Grand. Currently, designs on view mostly celebrate the Women’s World Cup. At right, lockers are personalized with each guest’s name and motivational brand phrases. Credit Nicholas Knight The trainers that lead classes at 45 Grand are some of the same ones that create workouts for Nike’s Training Club app — and teach at other higher-end workout spots around town such as City Row, where Alex Silver-Fagan, a beautiful and very chipper blonde who also happens to be a Wilhelmina fitness model, is an in-demand instructor. But the Nike+ services they offer at 45 Grand aren’t exclusive to the venue. Like at Nike’s Upper East Side and Flatiron locations, trainers at 45 Grand host runs through the Nike+ Run Club (just in time for long-distance runners to begin training for the N.Y.C. Marathon this November). And just like at other Nike stores across the country, having your gait analyzed or pants hemmed is just something you can do here.\nIf you seek out de Cárdenas’s advice about going into a workout at 45 Grand, he’ll tell you simply, with the tiniest trace of a laugh, “You gotta throw down.” It could arguably be his personal mission statement — the driving force behind his illustrious career, which includes designing the actress Parker Posey’s home and interiors for the likes of Baccarat in addition to jaw-dropping installations, furniture and pop-ups. And if you ask him if there’s anything he still hopes to see come of 45 Grand, it would be to host Caitlyn Jenner for a class. “She is an American hero. She’s an American athlete.”\nKarlie Kloss Shares Her Summertime Fitness Tips By ALAINNA LEXIE BEDDIE\nThe supermodel, a classically trained ballerina, still exercises at the barre, sneaks movement into her everyday life and has recently taken up meditation.\nMeeting Caitlyn, Saying Bye to Bruce — and Pronoun Confusion By LIESL SCHILLINGER\nLiesl Schillinger, an author and T contributor, asks: “He said, she said… it said?”",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — As large as the nation’s post-recession debt is, American taxpayers could catch a break for years to come from continued abnormally low interest rates, which hold down the cost of financing that debt and in turn limit the debt’s growth, congressional analysts said on Tuesday. Still, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , in its annual long-term budget outlook , projected that by the fiscal year 2040 the government’s debt would be equal to 107 percent of the country’s annual economic activity — up from the current 74 percent of gross domestic product. Last year the budget office projected the 2040 debt level to reach 111 percent of the economy, as measured by gross domestic product. The current level of public debt — exceeding $13 trillion and in large part a hangover from the 2007 to 2009 recession — is higher as a proportion of the economy than at any point in United States history except for seven years during and after World War II. Debt growth to the projected levels would be unsustainable, as the budget office warned, in what has become a regular feature of its reports. The favorable projections on interest rates provided the most significant and positive news. The effect of interest rates in tamping down or, conversely, worsening the effect of government debt underscores why market and government analysts pay such close attention to those rates. It also suggests how quickly taxpayers’ costs could pile up if economic conditions change, altering the current projections for low rates. While acknowledging “enormous uncertainty” about long-term projections, the budget office said its review of economic models and market analysts’ work strongly “suggests that participants in financial markets expect low interest rates well into the future, and the paths that they anticipate have fallen notably in the past year.” That downward revision in expectations for already low interest rates, while small, has a significant effect on the 25-year outlook for the cost of financing the government’s borrowing. Those interest payments on the debt are an expanding share of federal spending, squeezing allocations for domestic and military programs. But the budget office shaved a half-percentage point from its forecast of last year, putting the cost of interest on the debt at 4.2 percent of G.D.P., down from a projected 4.7 percent last year. By comparison, interest costs in this fiscal year are 1.3 percent of G.D.P. The budget office projected that real, inflation-adjusted interest rates on Treasury notes would average 2.3 percent in the next 25 years, down from a projected average of 2.5 percent in last summer’s annual report. Similarly, interest rates for all government debt would average 2 percent, down from 2.2 percent, the budget office projected. The budget office projected that the economy would grow on average 2.2 percent a year over 25 years, down slightly from the 2.3 percent projected last year – a forecast that continues to suggest an unimpressive contrast with the average 3.1 percent growth of the period between 1970 and 2007. The slight reduction in the economy’s predicted growth is “primarily because of the slowdown that C.B.O. anticipates in the growth of the labor force,” the budget office said, as “the fraction of the population that is of working age shrinks.” Loading...

      "text": " When Blanca opened in 2012, a 27-course tasting menu served at a counter behind a pizzeria in Bushwick sounded like the setup to a joke. (Second prize is 30 courses.) The restaurant does have its sense of humor, but it quickly proved that about cooking for maximum pleasure, it was unswervingly serious.\nCarlo Mirarchi, the chef and an owner of Blanca and its sprawling mother ship, Roberta’s , was a rigorous miniaturist, combining a few ingredients at a time into two- or three-bite compositions that were utterly complete, even if they left you wanting more. At 31, he already had an impressive sense of what to put on a plate and what to leave off.\n Related Coverage Blanca What he didn’t have yet was a repertoire deep enough for the length of the meals he served. My early dinners at Blanca were marked by dishes that seemed like placeholders, and there were moments when the kitchen’s reach exceeded its technical grasp. It was as if Mr. Mirarchi were giving you a tour of a mansion he’d bought before the contractor had finished the punch list. Most of the place was spectacular, but there were rooms where you would not want to spend the night.\n Cooking Newsletter Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice. And download Cooking for iPhone and iPad in the App Store .\nBeing a critic, I had a suggestion, hinted at in my two-star review that year: make the meal shorter and cheaper. Being a chef, Mr. Mirarchi ignored me and kept refining his marathon tastings, very gradually.\n“The menu changes so slowly that for us it’s like watching your hair grow,” Leslie Vinyard, Blanca’s welcoming and gracious service captain, remarked one night from behind the countertop. So it may have taken a while, but every time I’ve settled into one of the padded brown-leather captain’s chairs recently, nearly everything I’ve tasted has been remarkable in one way or another.\nOne dinner this spring got rolling with a fat little Pacific Northwest oyster. Sharing its deep cup-shaped shell were juicy round cells of finger lime that popped in my mouth like citrus caviar, and a pool of green juice pressed from roasted asparagus, an ingenious combination that teased a mild cucumber flavor out of the oyster.\nAdvertisement\n At the end of the night, asparagus came back. Samantha Short, the pastry chef, had made a sort of coconut semifreddo, silky on the tongue, which hovered over a spoonful or two of white asparagus soup seasoned with sugar and salt. Sweet and savory, tropical and vegetal flavors crashed together and bloomed into something daring and great. The desserts after some mega-tastings are gradual diminuendos. This was a mike drop.\nOver three meals since October, I’ve experienced all sorts of flavor detonations: a streaky fold of raw pancetta with a burst of black peppercorns; a salt-roasted Japanese sweet potato with an unexpectedly dreamy dressing of macadamia milk and ground espresso beans; a crunchy wedge of tart apple carrying a small, remarkable payload of garlic, olive oil, anchovies, fried bread crumbs and cardoons cooked in apple juice.\nAdvertisement\n I have also started looking forward to sunchokes, a vegetable that has a hard time getting more out of me than grudging acceptance. Blanca caramelized them deeply, steeped them in soy milk, then whipped them into a cream. A ragged leaf of toasted sea lettuce supplied a bottom note, and the crumb of beeswax and honey at the bottom of the dish made my eyes go wide, every time.\nThen there are the agnolotti parcels that are like Freshen Up gum from the dark side. They burst when you bite down with an oozing, inky-green liquid made from melted taleggio and phytoplankton. The flavor is like a distillation of spinach, seaweed and squid ink. It’s a totally disorienting sensation, and while I love it, not everyone will. I think of this course as the one guest-directed by David Lynch. It is when the dwarf starts to dance .\nOne of Mr. Mirarchi’s sillier conceits in the early days was making you wait more than two hours for an ordinary slice of filone, presented as its own course. You still wait, but now it’s worth it. The breads made by Nina Subhas may include a soft Hawaiian sweet roll with pineapple juice in the dough and black salt on top, and a flaky garlic knot that’s like a savory Danish. Or you may be given a chunk torn from a squat round loaf made from Roberta’s pizza dough. Brushed with olive oil, this steaming-hot pizza bread doesn’t need the house-made butter, not that I let that stop me.\nOnce, grilled snow crabs were served with a deliciously funky crab-innards sauce. Now the steamed legs of very recently living king crabs come with a saffron-colored slosh of melted butter sauce whipped with shaved bottarga. The sauce is an upgrade, less likely to step on the sweetness of the shellfish, and I’ve never again been served gelatinous, half-raw crab legs as I was in 2012. This has become one of New York’s essential dishes, along with the ’nduja raviolo, an explosion of spicy pork lava, the one item that has been on the lineup since opening night.\nMr. Mirarchi’s notion of what al dente means seems to have softened. So has the pasta, slightly, but I’ll deal with the extra-chewy core of tightly hand-rolled noodles to taste his creamy, yolk-rich carbonara with lamb fat and cured lamb breast.\nBeneath the body of Blanca’s menu is an Italian chassis, so after pasta come the meat courses. There may be a few rosy slices of roast duck placed beside a slow-burning beet mole, followed by porchetta with chimichurri. The servings are never very large and never as hot as I’d like, but the meat is always juicier and more concentrated than almost any other restaurant can manage.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n When you say “savory desserts,” some people look for the exits. None of these people have tasted Ms. Short’s intermezzos and finales. She can make the heat and the vegetal taste of poblano peppers seem like sensible, delicious additions to a cake. One night, her parting shot was a chocolate-Parmesan ice cream with shaved white truffles. It was another mike drop.\nOne could, and come to think of it one will, complain that Blanca offers no wine bottles under $80 and no glasses under $18. Customers who have torn a hole in their budget to afford the $195 for dinner, before tax and tip, shouldn’t have to drink beer all night. Not that this would be a terrible fate; Blanca’s beers are as varied and full of character as the sakes and wines. A course-by-course wine pairing can be had for $95, but Shanti Carson, the sommelier, excels at working with people who aren’t that thirsty.\nMs. Carson is also the one who placed the vinyl on the turntable when I decided to prove to the other 11 people at the counter that “ New York Groove ” isn’t the only good song on Ace Frehley’s first solo album.\nThe record collection, which Mr. Mirarchi may well have lifted straight from the garage of his childhood home, is one of the ways Blanca deflates high-end dining’s gassier pretensions. His aim has always been to run a restaurant that is both a luxury and a weird adventure. The entrance tells you everything. You walk into a cinder-block bomb shelter of a pizzeria, past the crowds eating pies with names like Lamb of God. You turn left at the bar, go out the door, take another left at the radio studio and a right at the tiki bar. Keep going past the shipping containers and the outdoor oven, walk down a couple of steps, through the door, and you’re inside Bushwick’s first three-star restaurant.\nBlanca NYT Critics’ Pick ★★★ 261 Moore Street\n(Bogart Street)\nBushwick\n347-799-2807\nblancanyc.com\nAtmosphere A very comfortable and relaxed counter where you watch the cooks bend in concentration over course after course. Servers are gracious and unpretentious, with a sense of fun.\nSound Friendly to conversation, even with Metallica on the turntable.\nMenu singlepage.com/blanca-4\nRecommended Dishes Tasting menu ($195) only.\nDrinks and Wine There is a fascinating range of sakes, beers and wines with character and finesse, as well as a $95 pairing option, but the absence of wines under $80 a bottle needs to be fixed.\nPrice $$$$ (very expensive)\nOpen Wednesday to Saturday for dinner.\nReservations Required.\nWheelchair Access A separate entrance is available for the dining room and accessible restroom.",

The HBO show’s previous record was the season premiere in April, which attracted eight million viewers. Last year’s season finale brought in 7.1 million viewers. JUNE 14, 2015 The rating for Sunday’s show, which completed the series’ fifth season, was especially strong considering the episode ran opposite Game 5 of the N.B.A. Finals, which drew 20.5 million viewers. The season finale’s total viewership will jump higher in the next few weeks after more people watch it on DVR, HBO Go and HBO Now, the network’s streaming service. Two weeks after the season premiere, the viewership for that episode jumped from 8.1 million to more than 18 million, the cable network said.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Nathan Brown, a professor at George Washington University who studies the Egyptian judicial system, said in an email that the verdicts in the two cases “endorse a conspiracy theory sufficiently odd that, if I were to hear it from a fellow passenger on the New York subway, I would quickly move to another car.” He called the court’s decision “a fundamental malfunction of the Egyptian state,” with the court accepting at face value the claims of the security services “after a hysterical media campaign fed by state bodies.” Mr. Morsi watched impassively, perhaps with the hint of a smile, from inside a metal cage that is used in Egyptian courts to hold defendants. The trial has been held in the same auditorium at the Police Academy in Cairo where Mr. Mubarak was tried while Mr. Morsi was president. Mr. Morsi was held in the cage with dozens of other defendants, mostly from the Muslim Brotherhood. After the first session of Mr. Morsi’s trial, thick soundproof glass was installed around the cage to prevent the defendants from interrupting the proceedings by shouting or chanting. The prison-break charges stemmed from the events of Jan. 28, 2011, in the last days of Mr. Mubarak’s rule, when the Egyptian police force collapsed in the face of huge demonstrations and the doors of the country’s jails were thrown open. Mr. Morsi, who at the time was a senior leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and the former chief of its parliamentary bloc, seemed to anticipate that he would be questioned about whether he was breaking the law by walking out. As soon as he was free, he called Al Jazeera to say that he was not fleeing justice. “If there is an official in Egypt that wants to get in contact with us, we’re here, I’m here, the telephone is here,” he said, in comments broadcast by the television network. “We will never run away.” Still, after he was overthrown, prosecutors charged that Mr. Morsi and others had escaped through an elaborate conspiracy involving both Hamas, the Sunni Muslim militant group in Gaza, and Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant group in Lebanon. The prosecutors claimed that the two groups had sent hundreds of fighters to assault Egypt’s prisons. Four other senior Brotherhood leaders who were jailed with Mr. Morsi also were sentenced to death in that case. One is Mohamed Badie, the Brotherhood’s top spiritual leader. Mr. Badie and Mr. Morsi still face other pending criminal cases and possible death sentences. In the espionage case, Mr. Morsi was sentenced on Tuesday to life in prison, which in Egypt is understood to mean 25 years. He was accused of collaborating with foreign powers against Egypt while he was president. The court did not disclose what evidence it found to support the allegations. In other political systems, the notion of an elected head of state committing espionage against his own government is almost self-contradictory, because the head of state is given broad latitude to decide what matters are state secrets and where the national interest lies. Three other defendants in custody received death sentences in that case, including Khairat el-Shater , the Brotherhood’s top financier and strategist. A number of defendants were tried and sentenced to death in absentia. One is Emad Shahin, a distinguished political scientist who now teaches at Georgetown University. In a statement, Amr Darrag, an exiled leader of the Brotherhood’s political wing, called the sentences “a historical peak of the tragedy currently unfolding in Egypt.” Yehia Hamed, another Brotherhood leader, said in the statement that the group continued to oppose the use of violence, but that the group was “extremely concerned that this repression — and today’s sentences — will lead some people to renounce nonviolent protest,” which “in turn strengthens the hand of ISIS and other extremist militant groups.” \nmerna thomas contributed reporting ",

      "text": "How Would ‘Ulysses’ Be Received Today? JUNE 9, 2015 Continue reading the main story Each week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. When James Joyce’s “Ulysses” was first published in 1922, it was banned for obscenity and the U.S. Postal Service burned copies. This week, in honor of Bloomsday on June 16, Charles McGrath and Rivka Galchen discuss how the book would be received if it were published for the first time today. By Charles McGrath Joyce’s book might seem preening, needlessly erudite, even a little old-fashioned in its naughty bits. Photo SEPT. 3, 2013 By the standards of today’s dirty books, “Ulysses” seems pretty tame, and it’s hard to put yourself back in the mind-set of those who took such strenuous offense in the ’20s, when the book was first published by the heroic Sylvia Beach. For some reason the passage that most upset the prosecutors was not the famous Molly Bloom soliloquy, or even the Nighttown sequence, which involves anal penetration, if you read carefully, but the relatively innocuous scene in which Leopold Bloom fondles himself while staring at Gerty MacDowell’s knickers. As Kevin Birmingham points out in “The Most Dangerous Book: The Battle for James Joyce’s ‘Ulysses,’ ” his valuable account of how the book got published, it wasn’t just sex that the censors worried about but the very fabric of civilization. If you let in even a little smut and self-abuse, there was no telling what chaos might follow. As we know now, the novel’s greatest transgressions were not against decency and morality but against the forms and conventions of fiction writing itself. The entire action of “Ulysses” takes place in a single day, skipping from character to character in seemingly no particular order. Stylistically, the book mingles high and low, poetry and banality, profundity and cliché. There are moments described from inside a character’s head, as well as stretches of pastiche and parody; burlesque chapters; a chapter in play form and one that’s a mock catechism; and even some sections that come close to gibberish. After reading the Sirens section — the one that begins: “Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyrining imperthnthn thnthnthn” — Ezra Pound worried that Joyce might have “got knocked on the head.” See More » “Ulysses” is a one-off. It’s telling that although countless writers as varied as Beckett, Virginia Woolf (even though she said she hated the book), Donald Barthelme and David Foster Wallace have been influenced by it, no one since Joyce has attempted anything on quite the same scale. Still, just about every device that Joyce employed is now a standard part of the novelist’s repertoire, and none of them raise much of an eyebrow anymore. The rules have so changed — and our notion of what is novelistically possible so expanded — that if “Ulysses” were to come along now, with no controversy to cash in on, it would probably be published by someplace like Dalkey Archive, not Random House, and it might not cause much of a stir at all. To a generation that has already read “Naked Lunch” and “Gravity’s Rainbow,” Joyce’s book might seem preening, needlessly erudite, even a little old-fashioned in its naughty bits. Thanks in part to the landmark Woolsey decision, which in 1933 ruled that “Ulysses” was a serious work of literature and not obscene, we can now read books that are far, far racier. (A fascinating detail in Langdon Hammer’s new biography of James Merrill is that one of the people Judge Woolsey turned to for help in reaching his decision was Charles Merrill, the poet’s father and a co-founder of Merrill Lynch. The judge wanted to know how Joyce’s book would strike a “person of average sex instincts.”) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It was mostly the fact of its being banned that brought so much attention to “Ulysses” in the first place, and it’s likely that a lot of the book’s early purchasers never finished it. Even today, when we have supposedly learned how to read it, “Ulysses” is far from a page-turner. On my first attempt, when I was a junior in high school, I gave up after 80 pages or so, and it took me a couple more tries to build up enough steam to make it all the way through. But “Ulysses” is also a book you can never exhaust. Whenever you go back, you find something you hadn’t noticed before — sometimes a joke, a pun, sometimes a heartwarming detail about Bloom, sometimes just a magical phrase like “the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.” At a moment when Knausgaard’s inwardly gazing “My Struggle” seems to be our model of the prose epic, the sheer largeness of Joyce’s ambition and scope of his invention seems both inspiring and a little mad — a relic of an era, perhaps, when people believed more trustingly in the power of fiction to remake the world. Charles McGrath was the editor of the Book Review from 1995 to 2004, and is now a contributing writer for The Times. Earlier he was the deputy editor and the head of the fiction department of The New Yorker. Besides The Times, he has written for The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The New Republic and Outside. He is the editor of two golf books — “The Ultimate Golf Book” and “Golf Stories” — and is currently working on an edition of John O’Hara’s stories for the Library of America. ◆ ◆ ◆ I did not come across a single contemporary reviewer describing the book as obscene. Photo Rivka Galchen Credit Illustration by R. Kikuo Johnson “I have read many books, this is by far the least interesting of them all,” one reviewer notes. “Dry, boring and self-­satisfied style. He might be a good writer but he should have used ­‘Ulysses’ as a starting point, as a construct in which he could fill a story,” notes another. Or ­simply, “grade: Hard to give a low enough grade to the single most destructive piece of Literature ever written, try (F × Googolplex).” But of course, we also find: “This is a fascinating book for those who have the patience and time to explore its intricate chapters and themes.” And, more traditionally informative, “Our hero is Leo Bloom, a Jew in Ireland married to an Irish sexpot named Mollie.” Another notes, “The author kept getting bogged down in details instead of moving the storyline along, because we don’t need to know everything about the characters, just enough to keep reading until the climax of the story; if you compare it with something like the Hunt for Red October you’ll see what I mean.” These are all contemporary reviews from Amazon. I can report that in my research I did not come across a single contemporary reviewer describing the book as obscene. Perhaps this accounts for why there aren’t really that many raves out there. Then again, since the book structurally occupies the fundamentally rave-review position of canonical, maybe few feel moved to state what is already essentially stated. \nAdvertisement ",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story For those who do not enter the process, Mr. Navarro said, there will be no mass roundups to deport people and the protocol is still being worked out. Instead, the government will handle each case individually and work in conjunction with the Haitian government for an orderly transfer of citizens. Responding to questions from other regional leaders, however, Mr. Navarro asserted the position his government has taken in the past: that the Dominican Republic, as a sovereign nation, has the right to determine its own immigration policy without the interference of other states. The migrant workers who have registered so far have been granted a 45-day grace period during which they can complete the process. Migrants are expected to produced a signed work permit from employers, who can be reluctant to provide such documentation. The deportations, which could begin in the coming days, have generated a more muted response from other countries when compared with the uproar stirred by the 2013 court ruling, which essentially ordered the mass denationalization of as many as 200,000 Dominican-born children. One reason for the relative diplomatic silence, including from the United States, is the troubled relationship many countries have with migrant workers who enter their borders illegally seeking employment, advocates argued. “Migrant deportation is something states don’t want to get into because they themselves want to continue to do such deportations,” said Liliana Gamboa, who coordinates an anti-discrimination project for the Open Society Foundations in the Dominican Republic. “I don’t know how much pushback there can be from other states.” Still, to the extent that deportations occur on a large scale, there is a fear that they will also ensnare people who are trying to comply with the law — whether they are children born in the Dominican Republic to migrant workers, or migrant workers who are trying to satisfy the paperwork requirements. Some advocates worry that the mechanism to identify potential deportees will be to target any dark-skinned people suspected of Haitian descent, whether they have papers or not. “There are no adequate screening mechanisms,” said Angelita K. Baeyens, the programs director at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. Efforts to process children born in the Dominican Republic whose parents never formally registered them have fallen short. Fewer than 9,000 of an estimated population of tens of thousands have registered themselves as foreigners, as required by the law, a process that in theory puts them on a path to naturalization. The status of these children is unclear, potentially leaving them vulnerable to deportation as well. “If these massive deportations occur, will they include by mistake people who were born in the Dominican Republic?” Ms. Gamboa said. “Will they follow the standards of international law? Will Haiti be able to receive this number of deportees? And what would their status be in Haiti?” Others have raised questions about the impact on the Dominican economy. For generations, Haitians have assumed the jobs that many Dominicans do not want, filling a vital part of the labor market, often at below market rates. Businesses, some experts say, could see their production costs rise if a large chunk of the labor force is removed. But that remains a distant threat. For now, activists like Mr. Enecia of Cedeso say that many are resigned to their deportation. “The criteria is based on racial discrimination,” he said. “Fear, desperation and anguish are the expressions of the people. They feel helpless.” \nPaulina Villegas contributed reporting. ",

Trump , a real estate developer and reality television star, has declared himself a candidate for the Republican nomination for president. Here is a look at what he will need to do if he hopes to win. Related Article Photo Donald Trump in Greenville, S.C., in May. Credit Travis Dove for The New York Times The Coalition \nMr. Trump could unite the most vituperative, fact-averse denouncers of President Obama (he was a champion of the \"birther\" camp that questioned whether the president was actually born in Hawaii); the many upwardly aspirational people who have attended his motivational speeches or purchased his business books; and at least some golfers who have played on his courses. It seems a stretch to think he will generate much support from the wealthy Republican establishment: Even in New York City, business leaders have long held Mr. Trump at arm's length. The Map \nMr. Trump’s glitzy displays do not impress many Republicans in Iowa, where he is still remembered for agreeing to headline a party fund-raiser in 2012 before canceling at the last minute. He would likely have to somehow outperform both Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio in Florida, where he is a part-time resident. If Mr. Trump could buy a state with an early nominating contest, like New Hampshire, and brand it with his name, it might help. The Message \nMr. Trump promises to “make America great again.” As someone best known for saying \"You're fired!\" in a country still recovering from a debilitating recession, he could face challenges establishing his credibility. But he has never had difficulty making himself heard. Why He Will Win \nWe are stumped. And we really tried. Why He Won't \nPerhaps the biggest reason, of many, is the Trump Tower-size pile of money that awaits if he instead signs for another season of his “Apprentice” franchise. More on NYTimes.com ",

      "title": "Study Supports Antibiotic Use to Treat Appendicitis",
      "text": " For more than 100 years, the standard treatment for appendicitis has been surgery. Now a large Finnish study provides the best evidence to date that most patients can be treated with antibiotics alone.\nThe study , published Tuesday in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, involved 530 patients aged 18 to 60 who agreed to have their treatment — antibiotics or surgery — decided at random.\nThree out of four who took antibiotics recovered easily, the researchers found: the pain vanished, and they went on with their lives. And none who had surgery after taking antibiotics was worse off for having waited.\n“The time has come to consider abandoning routine appendectomy for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis, ” Dr. Edward H. Livingston, a surgeon and editor at the journal, who was not involved with the study, wrote in an editorial accompanying the report .\nThe study comes amid growing questions about the routine use of surgery to treat appendicitis, which strikes about 300,000 Americans a year, afflicting one out of 10 adults at some point in their lives.\nThe new results only apply to uncomplicated appendicitis, stressed Dr. Paulina Salminen, a surgeon at Turku University Hospital in Finland and lead author of the new study. She and her colleagues excluded the 20 percent of patients with complicated cases — people with perforated appendices or abdominal abscesses, and those with a little, rock-like blockage of the appendix called an appendicolith.\nTo distinguish the complicated from the uncomplicated cases, the Finnish doctors used CT scans, which, Dr. Livingston said, are “almost perfect for diagnosis.”\nBut Dr. Philip S. Barie, a surgeon at Weill Cornell Medical College, noted that antibiotics were not sufficient for more than a quarter of the patients in the new study and said the failure rate was unacceptable.\nPatients should have the simple and safe operation to remove their appendix, he said, taking care of the problem quickly and permanently.\nDr. Livingston disagreed. When he saw the results, he said in an interview, his first thought was, “Wow. I’ve been waiting for this.”\nDr. Livingston began wondering about the role of surgery 10 years ago when he operated on a young man with appendicitis who experienced a rocky recovery. The case prompted him to review the medical literature.\nHe found that much of the original research was done by a surgeon, Dr. Reginald H. Fitz, who in 1886 investigated why people die from pelvic infections.\nDr. Fitz looked at autopsy reports and found many patients whose appendices had been inflamed. That led him to conclude that the appendix may become injured, then infected, then gangrenous; finally, he theorized, a lethal infection spreads through the pelvis.\nThe way to prevent this dire chain of events, Dr. Fitz decided, was to remove the appendix. But more recent research has shown that the infected appendix does not become “gangrenous,” and, as even Dr. Fitz noticed, some patients simply get better on their own.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story In the 1950s, soon after antibiotics were discovered, some doctors reported success using them to treat patients with appendicitis. But, Dr. Livingston wrote in his editorial, “So powerful is the perceived benefit of appendectomy for appendicitis that surgical treatment for appendicitis remains unquestioned, with seemingly little interest in studying the problem.”\nDr. Livingston also found that most appendices that perforate have already done so by the time the patient shows up at an emergency room. Those that have not perforated when the patient seeks medical help almost never do so.\nPeople with so-called uncomplicated appendicitis, he concluded, seem to have a different disease — one that can be treated with antibiotics.\n“The reason we take the appendix out and do it as an emergency is the belief, dating back to 1886, that the appendix will eventually become gangrenous and cause a pelvic abscess ,” said Dr. Livingston.\nEven with the results of the Finnish study, many questions remain.\nThe researchers decided to do open surgery instead of the more common laparoscopic surgery, Dr. Salminen said, in order to make their results generalizable to places where laparoscopic surgery is not available.\nShe added that although that was “a weakness” of the study, most of the surgical complications were from infections at the site of the incision, which could occur with laparascopy too.\nDr. Barie said the decision not to employ laparoscopic surgery, which tends to be safer than open surgery, flawed the study’s results.\nThe researchers also decided to give the patients taking antibiotics three days of intravenous drugs in the hospital, followed by a week of antibiotic pills at home. That, Dr. Salminen admits, probably was more than was needed.\nMany patients begged to get out of the hospital after a day, she said. Some just left on their own, saying they felt good and saw no need to stay.\nAn American group is planning a clinical trial, similar to the Finnish study, but comparing laparoscopic surgery and a less powerful antibiotic, given either as an injection followed by pills or as a one-day intravenous infusion followed by pills.\nA person who has had one episode of appendicitis is at higher than usual risk for another. The American team will also try to assess whether these patients are more likely to rush to the emergency room for a CT scan each time they experience mild abdominal symptoms.\nConceiveably, it could cost the medical system more in the end to keep scanning and perhaps treating these people than to simply remove their appendix with laparoscopic surgery during their initial bout with appendicitis.\n“Obviously, you can treat appendicitis with an antibiotic,” said Dr. David Flum, a surgeon at the University of Washington who will be a principal investigator in that study. “But from a patient’s point of view, should you?”\nAccumulating data has led other experts to raise an even more controversial idea: Perhaps antibiotics aren’t always necessary, either. It is possible, some researchers say, that most people with appendicitis would get better on their own if doctors did nothing.\nThe Finnish team is now planning a clinical trial to test that theory.\nLoading...

But euro-area leaders are likely to resist that appeal for direct intervention as long as possible, to avoid capitulating to Mr. Tsipras’s strategy. And in what amounted to a thinly veiled warning to Mr. Tsipras to avoid counting on a gathering of leaders to deliver Greece a better deal than finance ministers, Mr. Aamann of the European Council said that there “should be no illusions that an agreement becomes easier” or “more advantageous over time” with the leaders’ intervention. The acute frustration among European Union leaders with the government in Athens was on display Tuesday evening in Brussels where Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, told a news conference some of his proposals for Greece had been misrepresented. Mr. Juncker said he proposed a plan to Mr. Tsipras to support investment there until the end of the decade. But Mr. Juncker complained that the government in Athens failed to tell the Greek people “exactly what the commission, being one of the three institutions in charge of all this, are really proposing.” Mr. Juncker said he had had no contact with the Greek government since Sunday night, when negotiations in Brussels between senior Greek officials and representatives of creditors ended acrimoniously. Mr. Juncker was addressing a joint news conference with Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, who said Greece continued to meet the Atlantic alliance’s guidelines for member states to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. Mr. Stoltenberg declined to comment on a suggestion by Mr. Juncker for Greece to make a “modest cut” in military spending. “Greece has been for many, many years a highly valued and staunch ally,” Mr. Stoltenberg said.

      "text": "Kirk Kerkorian, Billionaire Investor in Film Studios and Casinos, Dies at 98 By JONATHAN KANDELL Supported By Photo Kirk Kerkorian, majority shareholder of MGM Mirage, at the Nevada Gaming Control Board hearing in Las Vegas in 2005. Credit Joe Cavaretta/Associated Press \nAdvertisement Kirk Kerkorian, the media-shy investor who became one of the richest Americans by betting his money on ventures like casinos and film studios, died Monday night at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 98. Richard E. Sobelle, general counsel of Mr. Kerkorian’s company, the Tracinda Corporation, confirmed the death. Born poor, Mr. Kerkorian was a brawling amateur boxer, a daredevil pilot and a high-stakes poker player before figuring out safer ways to amass a multibillion-dollar fortune. He pursued strategies that baffled business rivals and Wall Street analysts and that left him sometimes on the verge of bankruptcy. Other times, his moves brought him windfalls. He bought and sold MGM three times. He created a commercial airline, sold it and then purchased it again before reselling it for good. And in his 80s he made an unsolicited but successful bid for Mirage Resorts, the giant casino company controlled by Stephen A. Wynn, the uncrowned king of Las Vegas. Mr. Wynn was not the only mogul to underestimate Mr. Kerkorian. Mr. Kerkorian had earlier outmaneuvered better-known and seemingly more powerful entrepreneurs. Howard Hughes tried to undermine his Las Vegas projects, and Ted Turner mistakenly thought he had bought MGM studios from Mr. Kerkorian for a song. Photo Mr. Kerkorian in 1969. He was a brawling amateur boxer, a daredevil pilot and a high-stakes poker player before figuring out safer, more respectable ways to amass a multibillion-dollar fortune. Credit Los Angeles Times, via Associated Press But Mr. Kerkorian never publicly reveled in his successes and always avoided the limelight. “What good does it do being rich?” the journalist Dial Torgerson quoted him as saying in the biography “Kerkorian: An American Success Story” (Dial Press, 1974). “I can’t do what I want to do. I don’t like to get dressed up and go to see bankers. I hate that kind of thing.” Mr. Kerkorian skipped most shareholder meetings at the companies he owned, and he said little when he did attend. But he resented being portrayed as a recluse. “I have 30- or 40-year friendships that I prefer to meeting new people,” he told The Las Vegas Review-Journal in 1999 in one of his rare interviews. “Just because I don’t go to a lot of events and I’m not out in public all the time doesn’t mean I’m antisocial.” His close friends included Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra, who often joined him at Los Angeles restaurants and Las Vegas gambling tables. He was a polarizing figure. Some said he was an unscrupulous manipulator who disregarded the rights of minority shareholders. On occasion he was sued and forced to settle such allegations out of court. But his defenders insisted that any investors who stuck by him were bound to make big returns. “Kirk has always made money for people who buy in with him,” Lee Isgur, an analyst with Paine Webber, told The New York Times in 1985. Kerkor Kerkorian — he Americanized his name to Kirk as a boy — was born in Fresno, Calif., on June 6, 1917, one of four children of Armenian immigrants. His mother, Lily, was a homemaker; his father, Ahron, was a fruit merchant whose get-rich-quick schemes often left his family struggling to stay afloat. “We moved at least 20 times when I was a kid,” Mr. Kerkorian told Fortune magazine in 1969.\"We often could not pay our rent and would get booted out.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Young Kirk got no further than the eighth grade, leaving school to take odd jobs. He became a promising lightweight boxer, winning 29 of 33 amateur bouts, but quit the ring in 1939 to take flying lessons and soon became a private pilot and later an instructor. In World War II, Mr. Kerkorian ferried bomber planes across the Atlantic and as far as India for the British Royal Air Force. After the war he purchased surplus military transport planes, refurbished them and sold them around the world, using the profits to buy a small air charter operation, based in Los Angeles, in 1947. Mr. Kerkorian often flew Hollywood entertainers into Las Vegas, which was becoming a gambling capital, and joined them at the blackjack and dice tables, where he became renowned as a high roller. It was in Las Vegas where he met Jean Maree Hardy, a dancer and choreographer. They married in 1954 and had two daughters. That marriage ended in divorce after almost 30 years. (His first marriage to Hilda Schmidt had also ended in divorce, in 1951.) His daughters Tracy Kerkorian and Linda Kemper as well as three grandchildren survive him, a family spokesman said. Mr. Kerkorian bought property in Las Vegas, just off the Strip, in 1962. That year he merged his charter company, Trans International Airlines, with the Studebaker Corporation, retaining operating control. Using Studebaker revenue, he expanded the airline’s fleet and destinations. He then repurchased the airline in 1964 and left Studebaker. Over the next three years he sold the airline in two separate transactions, making more than $100 million in overall profits and funneling the proceeds into the three business arenas — airlines, gambling resorts and film studios — that would sustain him as an investor for the rest of his life. By the end of 1969 Mr. Kerkorian had beaten out the Bronfman family, the Canadian liquor magnates, for control of MGM and amassed almost 40 percent of its shares. Meanwhile, he began to develop his Las Vegas acreage, breaking ground in 1968 for what he promised would be the largest hotel and casino in the world. The project infuriated Hughes, the reclusive former airline and movie magnate, who had recently moved to Las Vegas intending to dominate the casino and resort business. Hughes announced a huge expansion of his own Sands Hotel, aimed at convincing creditors that Mr. Kerkorian’s International Hotel would not be viable in what looked like an overbuilt market. In the end, Mr. Kerkorian found other creditors and completed his hotel on schedule in 1969. Soon he was facing bigger threats. The 1969-70 recession caught him badly overextended. The Securities and Exchange Commission prevented his holding company, the International Leisure Corporation, from making a secondary offering of stock, which would have helped him repay his loans, because the Flamingo Hotel, an International Leisure property, had once been owned by racketeers. Mr. Kerkorian was sinking fast. His International Leisure stock was worth $180 million at the beginning of 1970, but a year later he was forced to sell half his holdings in the company for $16.5 million. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Sometimes you lose, but that’s the nature of the game,” he was quoted as saying by Time magazine in 1970. “There’s always another game and another chance to win.” He found one when he sought help in shoring up his finances from MGM, in which he had accumulated a controlling share. At his prodding, the MGM board announced that it would build the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, surpassing Mr. Kerkorian’s International Hotel as the world’s largest gambling and resort hotel. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The MGM Grand opened in 1973 with more than 2,000 rooms. A year later, Mr. Kerkorian increased his holdings in MGM to just over 50 percent. With a strong flow of revenue from his Las Vegas operations, Mr. Kerkorian sought to expand his Hollywood investments. He bought 25.5 percent of Columbia Pictures in 1978, which he later sold. In 1981, he lost a bid to buy 20th Century Fox but succeeded in acquiring United Artists. He then split MGM into two publicly owned entities: MGM/UA Entertainment, which included film and television production and a large library of films; and MGM Grand Hotels, which owned and managed hotels, casinos and luxury cruise ships. By 1986, Mr. Kerkorian had agreed to sell MGM/UA, which was struggling, to Mr. Turner, the cable television magnate, for $1.5 billion. Hollywood rivals and Wall Street analysts considered it a good deal for Mr. Kerkorian. It became a terrific one a year later, when Mr. Turner, crushed by debts, sold all but MGM’s film library back to Mr. Kerkorian for only $300 million. In effect, Mr. Kerkorian had sold off the MGM library for $1.2 billion. Mr. Kerkorian did not hold on to MGM/UA for long. In 1990, he sold it to the Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti and his holding company, Pathé Communications, for $1.3 billion. A year later Mr. Parretti was ousted by his main creditor, the French bank Crédit Lyonnais, which then sued Mr. Kerkorian, accusing him of committing fraud by knowingly selling worthless assets. The case was settled out of court in 1995 when Mr. Kerkorian agreed to pay an undisclosed amount. By then Mr. Kerkorian was focused on the biggest gamble of his career: an effort to take over the Chrysler Corporation. In 1995, with the support of its former chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, he proposed to buy Chrysler for $22.8 billion and take it private. Chrysler’s board rejected the proposal. But he and the board struck a deal in 1996 when he agreed to limit his Chrysler holdings to no more than 13.8 percent of its stock and the company agreed to rid itself of its nonautomotive businesses. In 1998, Daimler-Benz, the maker of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, acquired Chrysler in a $36 billion merger. The deal was a windfall for Mr. Kerkorian, raising the value of his Chrysler holdings to nearly $5 billion, more than triple the original investment he had made in 1990. Even as he battled Chrysler, Mr. Kerkorian was moving back into the film business. In 1996, after settling his legal disputes with Crédit Lyonnais, he bought back MGM/UA for $1.3 billion. It was Mr. Kerkorian’s third takeover of MGM, and he seemed determined to restore the company’s vitality. But he ended up selling it in 2004 to a consortium led by Sony. \nAdvertisement",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story But inheriting a trophy building and selling it in a rising market does not make a developer. Last spring, a broker approached Mr. Spitzer about a waterfront parcel in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a largely Hasidic community. Development and gentrification have been rampant to the north, ever since the waterfront was rezoned for residential development in 2005. But the deep recession in 2008 had upended projects planned for south of the Brooklyn Bridge. Mr. Spitzer quickly outbid other developers for the site. He said he decided to build rental housing rather than condominiums, and agreed to set aside 20 percent of the units for poor and working-class households. But with Mayor Bill de Blasio seeking to require as much as 30 percent affordable housing for what are known as 421-a projects, Mr. Spitzer wanted to get his project moving before the current regulations changed or expired this month. Photo A rendering of the proposed Spitzer Enterprises development, whose architect described it as a \"molded iceberg, sculpted to create the maximum number of views and outdoor spaces.” Credit ODA New York He scrapped the prior developer’s plans in favor of what he described as a chic set of buildings with towers rising 24 stories. Eran Chen, the project’s architect, described it as a “molded iceberg, sculpted to create the maximum number of views and outdoor spaces.” There is a park and an esplanade. “Eliot is very in touch with what people want,” said David Maundrell of Apartments and Lofts, which is marketing the property. “He’s done his research. We really want to make this authentic Brooklyn, not an extension of Manhattan.” Mr. Spitzer said he had come to rely on Charles Morisi, a 30-year veteran of Spitzer Enterprises, and had brought on zoning and real estate lawyers, as well as Mr. Chen, of ODA Architecture. Before his father’s death, Mr. Spitzer made a big bet: He put together a development site in 2013 on the Far West Side of Manhattan, another once-decaying industrial area that is suddenly flush with construction cranes. He may build a hotel, a boutique office building or both. For now, he is not talking, restricting his comments to the project in South Williamsburg, an area that he believes is ripe for development. The $1.5 billion Domino development has started only a couple of blocks to the north. There is a condominium building going up across Kent Avenue from his site. And there are rumors that a new developer is reviving a big project to the south. The project is not without its challenges. There are hundreds if not thousands of apartments underway nearby. And other developers in the area say Mr. Spitzer will need to get the highest rents for his project to make sense, given the price he paid for the land. Mr. Spitzer brings his characteristic self-confidence to the question. “Can Williamsburg absorb 4,000 units?” he asked. “I don’t think there’s any question the answer is yes.” For now, Mr. Spitzer also puts to rest any question about his immediate future. Does television still hold some allure for the man that not too long ago appeared on MSNBC, CNN, the “Good Day New York” program on the city’s Fox station, “The Tonight Show” and the “Colbert Report”? “I watch it occasionally,” he joked, confessing to an affection for “Aquarius,” a drama on NBC about a detective tracking the 1960s cult-killer Charles Manson. As for Mr. Spitzer’s resurrecting his political ambitions, Mr. Nass, the childhood friend, said that he “would never say never.” “But for the time being, he’s focused on the real estate world,” he added. “He’s so bright he’ll do well in whatever venue he goes to.” Mr. Spitzer acknowledged that he faced a learning curve when it comes to building on the Far West Side, or in Brooklyn. But, he said, “there’s no learning curve on the financial side of stuff.” A version of this article appears in print on June 16, 2015, on page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Spitzer Charges Into Family’s Real Estate Business With Big Project.

      "text": "OPEN Graphic The new refugee flow has led to accusations by Turkish officials and rebels elsewhere in Syria that Kurdish militias were forcibly displacing Arab civilians, although no clear evidence of ethnic cleansing has come to light. The United Nations said the refugees were fleeing fighting in the area, and that some of them had come from Iraq. It remained unclear how many Islamic State fighters had been killed in the battle, and the fact that the jihadists had apparently not used car bombs — their weapon of choice — to defend the town suggested that they had not put up much of a fight. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, said that at least 40 Islamic State fighters had been killed in coalition airstrikes on convoys as they fled. The Turkish military said it had detained five men accused of being members of the Islamic State at the border crossing on Monday, Turkish news media reported. Saleh Muslim, a Kurdish activist, said by telephone from Syria that opposition forces were now fighting Islamic State militants in villages farther south on the road to Raqqa, but that they were filling them with explosives before leaving, a tactic the group has used to devastating effect in both Syria and Iraq. \nCeylan Yeginsu and Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Maher Samaan from Beirut, Lebanon.

Credit Cheros A.C. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Por Randal C. Archibold y Paulina Villegas CIUDAD DE MÉXICO – Su iglesia le dio la espalda, su familia lo desalentó de empezar una batalla pública y el gobierno del estado donde vive juró que nunca ocurriría. Pero ocurrió. Hiram González se casó con su novio, Severiano Chávez, el año pasado en Chihuahua, al norte del país, que, al igual que muchos otros estados mexicanos, únicamente permite el matrimonio entre un hombre y una mujer No obstante, González y docenas de parejas homosexuales han encontrado en los meses recientes a un poderoso aliado: la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación . Sentencia tras sentencia, la Corte ha dictaminado que las leyes estatales que sólo permiten el matrimonio entre parejas heterosexuales son discriminatorias. Aunque las sentencias se han dictado sin bombos ni platillos, han resultado en la legalización del matrimonio homosexual en México sin consagrarlo en la ley. América Proyecto beta que busca la mejor manera de ofrecer la cobertura global de The New York Times en español. See More » “Cuando escuché al juez decir que estábamos casados legalmente, rompí en llanto”, dijo González, de 41 años. Al igual que casi todas las parejas del mismo sexo que se casan en México, él y su pareja necesitaron una resolución judicial para poder intercambiar sus votos. Photo Víctor Manuel Aguirre, a la izquierda, y Víctor Fernando Urias, al centro, con el alcalde de Mexicali, la ciudad en donde se casaron. Credit Alex Cossio/Associated Press Mientras Estados Unidos está a la espera de que la Suprema Corte pronuncie una sentencia histórica sobre el matrimonio gay , las resoluciones del tribunal mexicano han sumado al país a la lista de naciones latinoamericanas que permiten las uniones entre parejas del mismo sexo. Argentina , Uruguay y Brasil ya permiten el matrimonio entre dos personas del mismo sexo . Chile planea reconocer este matrimonio civil en este año; Ecuador aprobó las uniones civiles en abril y Colombia les otorga a las parejas homosexuales los mismos derechos que a las parejas heterosexuales unidas en matrimonio. “Es un cambio enorme pensando en cómo eran las cosas hace 10 años”, comentó Jason Pierceson, catedrático de la Universidad de Illinois en Springfield, quien estudia las tendencias en el matrimonio homosexual en América Latina. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story El cambio en México, el segundo país más grande de Latinoamérica después de Brasil, es resultado de una estrategia jurídica que usaron los defensores para circunvalar las legislaturas estatales, que se han mostrado renuentes, y a menudo hostiles, a legalizar el matrimonio gay. En 2009, la Ciudad de México, un distrito federal y una enorme isla liberal en un país socialmente conservador, legalizó el matrimonio homosexual, convirtiéndose en la primera ciudad de Latinoamérica en tomar ese paso. Desde entonces ha habido 5297 matrimonios entre personas del mismo sexo, quienes algunas veces viajan a la ciudad provenientes de otros estados. De los 31 estados de la nación mexicana, sólo uno, Coahuila, cerca de la frontera de Texas, ha legalizado el matrimonio homosexual. Un segundo estado, Quintana Roo, donde se encuentra Cancún, ha permitido las uniones entre parejas homosexuales desde el año 2012, cuando los defensores señalaron que su código civil no estipula, en lo que respecta al matrimonio, que las parejas deban estar compuestas por un hombre y una mujer. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story En casi todo el resto del país el matrimonio se define legalmente como la unión entre un hombre y una mujer, leyes que pueden prevalecer en el papel a pesar de las sentencias de la corte. La Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación confirmó la ley de la Ciudad de México en 2010, añadiendo que otros estados tienen que reconocer las uniones que se efectúen en dicha ciudad. Los defensores del matrimonio homosexual vieron en esto una oportunidad para usar las decisiones de la Corte para afirmar que las leyes matrimoniales en otros estados eran discriminatorias. La Suprema Corte, teniendo en cuenta sentencias internacionales y tratados en contra de la discriminación suscritos por México, ha reiterado su posición, pronunciando órdenes judiciales en casos específicos que permiten que las parejas homosexuales se casen en estados donde las leyes lo prohíben. Este mes se vivió un momento decisivo, cuando la corte se extendió en sus resoluciones para emitir un decreto que estipula que cualquier ley estatal que limite el matrimonio al matrimonio heterosexual es discriminatoria. “Como la finalidad del matrimonio no es la procreación, no tiene razón justificada que la unión matrimonial sea heterosexual, ni que se enuncie como ‘entre un solo hombre y una sola mujer’”, establece la resolución y agrega, “Dicha enunciación resulta discriminatoria en su mera expresión”. La sentencia no elimina automáticamente las leyes matrimoniales estatales. Pero sí permite que las parejas homosexuales a las que se les niegan los derechos matrimoniales en sus estados soliciten resoluciones judiciales de jueces de distrito, quienes ahora están obligados a pronunciar dichas sentencias. “Sin duda, el matrimonio gay es legal en todas partes”, declaró Estefanía Vela Barba, profesora asociada del CIDE, el Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas, A.C. en la Ciudad de México. “Si llega una pareja del mismo sexo y el código dice que el matrimonio es entre un hombre y una mujer y para fines reproductivos, la corte dice: ‘Ignórenlo, el matrimonio es para dos personas’”. La Iglesia Católica Romana, con frecuencia una fuerza social y políticamente influyente en un país que es 83 por ciento católico, se opuso a la sentencia con el argumento de que la Corte había desacatado abiertamente dos milenios de convención. “Reiteramos nuestra convicción, con base en razones científicas, antropológicas, filosóficas, sociales y religiosas, de que la familia, la célula de la sociedad, se funda en el matrimonio entre un hombre y una mujer”, expresó Monseñor Eugenio Lira Rugarcía, Secretario General de la Conferencia del Episcopado Mexicano, en un correo electrónico el domingo en respuesta a la decisión. Y añadió que la postura de la iglesia “está declarada en siglos de tradición jurídica occidental, acumulada y profundizada a través de nuestra historia por legisladores y jueces de muy diferentes escuelas de pensamiento e ideologías”. \nAdvertisement ",

Inside Continue reading the main story CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is at Pluto 's doorstep, following an incredible journey of nine years and 3 billion miles. Four weeks from Tuesday — on July 14 — New Horizons will make its closest approach to Pluto. The spacecraft will fly within 7,750 miles, inside the orbits of Pluto's five known moons. That's the approximate distance between Seattle and Sydney. It will be the first spacecraft to explore the tiny, icy world once considered a full-fledged planet. As of Tuesday, New Horizons was just over 20 million miles from Pluto. That's closer than Earth is to neighbor Venus, at their closest point. Flight controllers fired a thruster on the spacecraft over the weekend to fine-tune its path. \"This is one charged-up team,\" principal investigator Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado said last week. \"They know that they're getting to do something very special because nothing like this has happened\" since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune in 1989. NASA's first interplanetary success was at Venus, with Mariner 2 in 1962. Stern added: \"We're going to turn a point of light into a planet and its moons overnight in the next month.\" The Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, is operating the spacecraft for NASA. The lab also designed and built the relatively lightweight craft, about the size of a baby grand piano. It carries seven science instruments; the cameras have been photographing the planet since January. The latest pictures, taken at the end of May and beginning of June, show large dark regions toward the bottom of Pluto. Scientists are eager to learn the size and shape of these dark spots, as well as their exact location. Images will keep improving with every step closer to Pluto. \"It's very fascinating to see this level of detail,\" deputy project scientist Cathy Olkin said during an update broadcast Tuesday. Pluto was discovered by the late American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. Its moons, the fifth unmasked as recently as 2012, also bear names related to the mythological underworld: big moon Charon and mini-moons Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. More moons could be out there. \"We're going to write the textbook. We know very little about the Pluto system now,\" Stern said. \"It's really a mission of raw exploration, flying into the unknown to see what's there.\" New Horizons' $700 million mission began with a 2006 launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida. ___",

      "text": "Answering Questions About Your Relationship JUNE 11, 2015 Continue reading the main story Admittedly, my husband and I resemble each other slightly. We both have beards and thick-frame glasses (as well as two ears, a nose and mouth). But we are often asked by strangers if we are brothers (once even, if we are twins). This makes me uncomfortable. I doubt straight couples are asked if they are siblings. Why should we be treated differently? While remaining polite, I would like a reply that makes them uncomfortable, too, so they understand their question is inappropriate. ERIC, BOSTON I have taken some flak lately — I know! I can’t believe it either — for redirecting questions. People ask for pithy put-downs or directions on locking estrangements in place, and I try to woo them from their angry corners. It is not always my job to give the people what they want. Some readers object. See More » So, here’s to compromise: Eric may (but I wish he wouldn’t) say: “I hope we’re not brothers. Or we’re going to have to rethink that whole incest taboo.” That should make people uncomfortable and think twice before asking strangers if they are siblings. But let’s hope Eric takes another path. These strangers have picked up on the warmth and intimacy between spouses. But lacking the experience to label it properly, they leap instead to the fraternal bond. Wouldn’t it be better for Eric and his husband (and the rest of our L.G.B.T. tribe) for strangers to receive a smiling response, “No, we’re married, not brothers”? The uninitiated are edified about jumping to conclusions and will not be terrified of snarky gay people in the future. Still, this leaves Eric’s discomfort at being treated differently from straight couples, which is even more reason for friendliness. To help strangers understand that we are all pretty much the same, give them a little leeway to note minor differences. Absolutely No Returns Twelve years ago, I passed on a handmade quilt to a first cousin whom I had never met. I thought she might enjoy it, and I didn’t have room for it in my apartment. I attached a laminated “promise document” that she would keep it in the family. Now I want the quilt back to share with other relatives. She was coy, at first, about having the quilt but finally produced a picture. But she absolutely refuses to return it and asked me never to contact her again. How do I handle this? CYNTHIA, NEW YORK Start by not sending quilts to strangers. Or if you insist, call the transfer a loan that you may call in at any time. I respect your attachment to the quilts (and lamination machine), but the terms of your gift required only that your cousin keep it in the family. She has. Now move on. You are only going to drive yourself crazy. And little as I know of needlework, I doubt that’s the point of “crazy quilts.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Time to Come Clean My friend and I are housekeepers at high-end homes. Recently, she told me she was no longer working with one of her regular clients because the house was being remodeled. That is true, but the client was also unhappy with my friend’s work. In fact, she offered me the job. I declined. But my friend has no idea. She is keeping her calendar open for when the remodel is complete. Should I tell her the truth? ANONYMOUS As hard as it is to be fired, it is, strangely, often even harder to do the firing. (I have been on both sides of this miserable equation.) So, when a convenient excuse, like a renovation, pre-empts the need for a tough talk, is anyone surprised that the homeowner snatched it and took the easy way out? But you have some intel your friend needs. She is holding out for a gig that will never resume. Say: “I’m sorry to tell you this, but Jean Harris wasn’t entirely honest with you. She offered me her cleaning job. I turned it down out of respect for our friendship. But I wanted you to have all the information.” True, messengers are sometimes caught up in the crossfire. But I’d rather help a pal here than worry about my own skin. She’ll Have Water I work at a theater and receive complimentary tickets to our plays, worth about $75 each. I invite friends to come with me for free. Afterward, we go for drinks. It bothers me that friends rarely offer to buy me one to thank me for their tickets. Am I being unreasonable? CHRISTINA, NEW HAVEN (Small panic attack as I add up all the free books that friends in publishing have given me.) Even though your tickets are valuable, your friends know you got them free. True, you worked hard for this perk; but also true, it’s more fun to see plays with friends. You are not being unreasonable at all, but there are no thank-you gifts less satisfying than the ones we have to ask for. Can you rethink the benefit as “free tickets for you and a friend”? Otherwise, sell the extras on StubHub, which is probably in violation of company rules. \nFor help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ­@nytimes.com or SocialQ on Facebook .

      "text": " WASHINGTON — The House voted convincingly Tuesday to allow Congress six more weeks to ponder ways to get a trade bill to President Obama ’s desk before the August recess, just days after Democrats delivered an embarrassing defeat to the administration’s economic policy agenda.\nHouse Republicans were set to take another vote on Trade Adjustment Assistance, which provides relief for workers displaced by global trade pacts. Democrats have long supported such programs, but last Friday voted against it as a way of undermining the president’s push for accelerated negotiating authority known as fast track.\nUnions and environmental groups strongly opposed giving the president fast-track authority to negotiate a broader agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because they say it would hurt American workers and loosen environmental safeguards. The proposed global accord, which would affect 40 percent of the world’s economy, would tie together 12 nations along the Pacific Ocean.\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner instead pivoted to an interim measure to extend that vote until the end of July, when other measures like the highway funding program will be close to expiration. The vote was 236 to 189.\nThe delay could enable lawmakers to tie the trade program to other more popular measures later this summer as a way of luring approval from reluctant members of both parties.\n“We remain committed to getting T.P.A. done,” said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, “and this will give the president more time to communicate the consequences of not moving forward with his party.”\nAnother possibility under discussion would be to vote for a bill that only includes the accelerated authority for the president, decoupling it from the worker assistance provision.\nThis would place the Senate, which has already passed its own trade package, in the position of negotiating with the House for a final package that did not include workers assistance that Democrats have backed for four decades. In an odd twist, the White House might quietly endorse this strategy because Mr. Obama is eager to get the trade deal done.\n“I don’t think there’s a deadline,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, who has supported previous trade deals. “I don’t think anyone is going to walk away from the table.”\nYet Tuesday morning, many Democrats continued to rail against it. “We don’t want to give up our leverage, that’s the key point,” said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, at a news conference speaking for more than a dozen House Democrats.\nGiven the complex dynamics on trade, it was unclear whether Republicans would approve the extension of the vote on trade adjustment assistance, which will be attached to an unrelated intelligence measure. But in the end, they went for it.\nMost in the party have generally been opposed to trade adjustment assistance, arguing that it is a costly and unproven program. Many are not eager to cast a yes vote for a procedural measure to move it back to the House floor.\nJosh Earnest, a White House spokesman, suggested Tuesday that Mr. Obama’s efforts to win support from House Democrats might have cooled for now. “I don’t expect a lot of arm twisting” over trade at the White House congressional picnic on Wednesday, he said.\nLoading...

      "text": " KUBINKA, Russia — President Vladimir V. Putin said on Tuesday that Russia would add more than 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles to its nuclear arsenal this year, prompting Secretary of State John Kerry to express his concern and NATO ’s chief to accuse Moscow of dangerous “saber rattling.”\nMr. Putin made his announcement a day after Russian officials denounced a plan by the United States to station tanks and heavy weapons in NATO member states on Russia’s border as the most aggressive act by Washington since the Cold War.\n“More than 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles able to overcome even the most technically advanced antimissile defense systems will be added to the makeup of the nuclear arsenal this year,” Mr. Putin, flanked by army officers, said in a speech at an arms fair west of Moscow.\nIntercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, have a minimum range of more than 3,400 miles. Mr. Putin gave no more details of which particular missiles were being added to the nuclear arsenal.\nHe has repeatedly urged Russia to maintain its nuclear deterrence to counter what he sees as growing security threats.\nSuch comments have helped whip up anti-Western sentiment and rally support behind Mr. Putin, but have caused disquiet in the West, particularly countries on or near Russia’s borders that were under Soviet domination during the Cold War.\nResponding quickly to Mr. Putin’s remarks, Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, accused Russia of unwarranted “saber rattling,” calling it “destabilizing and dangerous.”\nAt a news briefing in Brussels, Mr. Stoltenberg said such rhetoric from Moscow explained the Western alliance’s increased preparedness on the part of its forces to defend its member states closest to Russia.\n“This nuclear saber rattling of Russia is unjustified,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “This is something we are addressing, and it’s also one of the reasons we are now increasing the readiness and preparedness of our forces.”\n“We are responding by making sure that NATO also in the future is an alliance which provides deterrence and protection for all allies against any threat,” he added.\nMr. Kerry, speaking to reporters in Washington, said, “It does concern me.”\n“Nobody should hear that kind of announcement from the leader of a powerful country and not be concerned about what the implications are,” he added.\nTension has flared anew between Russia and Western powers over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis, in which pro-Russian separatist forces have seized a large part of the country’s east after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in early 2014.\nThe European Union and United States imposed economic sanctions on Russia. But Washington and Moscow are still bound by a 2010 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that caps deployed strategic nuclear warheads at 1,550 each and limits the numbers of strategic nuclear missile launchers to 800 by 2018.\nThe fair that opened on Tuesday to exhibit Russian arms and military equipment was the latest example of Moscow showcasing its modernized armed forces.\nBut lavish military spending is burdening Russia’s national budget at a time when the economy is sliding toward recession, hammered by low oil prices and Western sanctions.\nThe Kremlin portrays spending on the Russian arms sector as a driver of economic growth, but Mr. Putin’s critics say it is excessive and comes at the expense of social needs.\nLoading...

      "text": "OPEN Graphic The new refugee flow has led to accusations by Turkish officials and rebels elsewhere in Syria that Kurdish militias were forcibly displacing Arab civilians, although no clear evidence of ethnic cleansing has come to light. The United Nations said the refugees were fleeing fighting in the area, and that some of them had come from Iraq. It remained unclear how many Islamic State fighters had been killed in the battle, and the fact that the jihadists had apparently not used car bombs — their weapon of choice — to defend the town suggested that they had not put up much of a fight. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, said that at least 40 Islamic State fighters had been killed in coalition airstrikes on convoys as they fled. The Turkish military said it had detained five men accused of being members of the Islamic State at the border crossing on Monday, Turkish news media reported. Saleh Muslim, a Kurdish activist, said by telephone from Syria that opposition forces were now fighting Islamic State militants in villages farther south on the road to Raqqa, but that they were filling them with explosives before leaving, a tactic the group has used to devastating effect in both Syria and Iraq. \nCeylan Yeginsu and Karam Shoumali contributed reporting from Istanbul, and Maher Samaan from Beirut, Lebanon.

      "text": "Kirk Kerkorian, Billionaire Investor in Film Studios and Casinos, Dies at 98 By JONATHAN KANDELL Supported By Photo Kirk Kerkorian, majority shareholder of MGM Mirage, at the Nevada Gaming Control Board hearing in Las Vegas in 2005. Credit Joe Cavaretta/Associated Press \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Kirk Kerkorian, the media-shy investor who became one of the richest Americans by betting his money on ventures like casinos and film studios, died Monday night at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 98. Richard E. Sobelle, general counsel of Mr. Kerkorian’s private investment company, the Tracinda Corporation, confirmed the death. Born poor, Mr. Kerkorian was a brawling amateur boxer, a daredevil pilot and a high-stakes poker player before figuring out safer ways to amass a multibillion-dollar fortune. He pursued strategies that baffled business rivals and Wall Street analysts and that left him sometimes on the verge of bankruptcy. Other times, his moves brought him windfalls. He bought and sold MGM three times. He created a commercial airline, sold it and then purchased it again before reselling it for good. And in his 80s he made an unsolicited but successful bid for Mirage Resorts, the giant casino company controlled by Stephen A. Wynn, the uncrowned king of Las Vegas. Mr. Wynn was not the only mogul to underestimate Mr. Kerkorian. Mr. Kerkorian had earlier outmaneuvered better-known and seemingly more powerful entrepreneurs. Howard Hughes tried to undermine his Las Vegas projects, and Ted Turner mistakenly thought he had bought MGM studios from Mr. Kerkorian for a song. Photo Mr. Kerkorian in 1969. He was a brawling amateur boxer, a daredevil pilot and a high-stakes poker player before figuring out safer, more respectable ways to amass a multibillion-dollar fortune. Credit Los Angeles Times, via Associated Press But Mr. Kerkorian never publicly reveled in his successes and always avoided the limelight. “What good does it do being rich?” the journalist Dial Torgerson quoted him as saying in the biography “Kerkorian: An American Success Story” (Dial Press, 1974). “I can’t do what I want to do. I don’t like to get dressed up and go to see bankers. I hate that kind of thing.” Mr. Kerkorian skipped most shareholder meetings at the companies he owned, and he said little when he did attend. But he resented being portrayed as a recluse. “I have 30- or 40-year friendships that I prefer to meeting new people,” he told The Las Vegas Review-Journal in 1999 in one of his rare interviews. “Just because I don’t go to a lot of events and I’m not out in public all the time doesn’t mean I’m antisocial.” His close friends included Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra, who often joined him at Los Angeles restaurants and Las Vegas gambling tables. He was a polarizing figure. Some said he was an unscrupulous manipulator who disregarded the rights of minority shareholders. On occasion he was sued and forced to settle such allegations out of court. But his defenders insisted that any investors who stuck by him were bound to make big returns. “Kirk has always made money for people who buy in with him,” Lee Isgur, an analyst with Paine Webber, told The New York Times in 1985. Kerkor Kerkorian — he Americanized his name to Kirk as a boy — was born in Fresno, Calif., on June 6, 1917, one of four children of Armenian immigrants. His mother, Lily, was a homemaker; his father, Ahron, was a fruit merchant whose get-rich-quick schemes often left his family struggling to stay afloat. “We moved at least 20 times when I was a kid,” Mr. Kerkorian told Fortune magazine in 1969.\"We often could not pay our rent and would get booted out.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Young Kirk got no further than the eighth grade, leaving school to take odd jobs. He became a promising lightweight boxer, winning 29 of 33 amateur bouts, but quit the ring in 1939 to take flying lessons and soon became a private pilot and later an instructor. In World War II, Mr. Kerkorian ferried bomber planes across the Atlantic and as far as India for the British Royal Air Force. After the war he purchased surplus military transport planes, refurbished them and sold them around the world, using the profits to buy a small air charter operation, based in Los Angeles, in 1947. Mr. Kerkorian often flew Hollywood entertainers into Las Vegas, which was becoming a gambling capital, and joined them at the blackjack and dice tables, where he became renowned as a high roller. It was in Las Vegas where he met Jean Maree Hardy, a dancer and choreographer. They married in 1954 and had two daughters. That marriage ended in divorce after almost 30 years. (His first marriage to Hilda Schmidt had also ended in divorce, in 1951.) His daughters Tracy Kerkorian and Linda Ross Hilton Kemper as well as three grandchildren survive him, a family spokesman said. (Mr. Kerkorian named his investment firm, Tracinda, which is based in Beverly Hills, after his daughters.) Mr. Kerkorian bought property in Las Vegas, just off the Strip, in 1962. That year he merged his charter company, Trans International Airlines, with the Studebaker Corporation, retaining operating control. Using Studebaker revenue, he expanded the airline’s fleet and destinations. He then repurchased the airline in 1964 and left Studebaker. Over the next three years he sold the airline in two separate transactions, making more than $100 million in overall profits and funneling the proceeds into the three business arenas — airlines, gambling resorts and film studios — that would sustain him as an investor for the rest of his life. By the end of 1969 Mr. Kerkorian had beaten out the Bronfman family, the Canadian liquor magnates, for control of MGM and amassed almost 40 percent of its shares. Meanwhile, he began to develop his Las Vegas acreage, breaking ground in 1968 for what he promised would be the largest hotel and casino in the world. The project infuriated Hughes, the reclusive former airline and movie magnate, who had recently moved to Las Vegas intending to dominate the casino and resort business. Hughes announced a huge expansion of his own Sands Hotel, aimed at convincing creditors that Mr. Kerkorian’s International Hotel would not be viable in what looked like an overbuilt market. In the end, Mr. Kerkorian found other creditors and completed his hotel on schedule in 1969. Soon he was facing bigger threats. The 1969-70 recession caught him badly overextended. The Securities and Exchange Commission prevented his holding company, the International Leisure Corporation, from making a secondary offering of stock, which would have helped him repay his loans, because the Flamingo Hotel, an International Leisure property, had once been owned by racketeers. Mr. Kerkorian was sinking fast. His International Leisure stock was worth $180 million at the beginning of 1970, but a year later he was forced to sell half his holdings in the company for $16.5 million. \nAdvertisement “Sometimes you lose, but that’s the nature of the game,” he was quoted as saying by Time magazine in 1970. “There’s always another game and another chance to win.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story He found one when he sought help in shoring up his finances from MGM, in which he had accumulated a controlling share. At his prodding, the MGM board announced that it would build the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, surpassing Mr. Kerkorian’s International Hotel as the world’s largest gambling and resort hotel. The MGM Grand opened in 1973 with more than 2,000 rooms. A year later, Mr. Kerkorian increased his holdings in MGM to just over 50 percent. With a strong flow of revenue from his Las Vegas operations, Mr. Kerkorian sought to expand his Hollywood investments. He bought 25.5 percent of Columbia Pictures in 1978, which he later sold. In 1981, he lost a bid to buy 20th Century Fox but succeeded in acquiring United Artists. He then split MGM into two publicly owned entities: MGM/UA Entertainment, which included film and television production and a large library of films; and MGM Grand Hotels, which owned and managed hotels, casinos and luxury cruise ships. By 1986, Mr. Kerkorian had agreed to sell MGM/UA, which was struggling, to Mr. Turner, the cable television magnate, for $1.5 billion. Hollywood rivals and Wall Street analysts considered it a good deal for Mr. Kerkorian. It became a terrific one a year later, when Mr. Turner, crushed by debts, sold all but MGM’s film library back to Mr. Kerkorian for only $300 million. In effect, Mr. Kerkorian had sold off the MGM library for $1.2 billion. Mr. Kerkorian did not hold on to MGM/UA for long. In 1990, he sold it to the Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti and his holding company, Pathé Communications, for $1.3 billion. A year later Mr. Parretti was ousted by his main creditor, the French bank Crédit Lyonnais, which then sued Mr. Kerkorian, accusing him of committing fraud by knowingly selling worthless assets. The case was settled out of court in 1995 when Mr. Kerkorian agreed to pay an undisclosed amount. By then Mr. Kerkorian was focused on the biggest gamble of his career: an effort to take over the Chrysler Corporation. In 1995, with the support of its former chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, he proposed to buy Chrysler for $22.8 billion and take it private. Chrysler’s board rejected the proposal. But he and the board struck a deal in 1996 when he agreed to limit his Chrysler holdings to no more than 13.8 percent of its stock and the company agreed to rid itself of its nonautomotive businesses. In 1998, Daimler-Benz, the maker of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, acquired Chrysler in a $36 billion merger. The deal was a windfall for Mr. Kerkorian, raising the value of his Chrysler holdings to nearly $5 billion, more than triple the original investment he had made in 1990. Even as he battled Chrysler, Mr. Kerkorian was moving back into the film business. In 1996, after settling his legal disputes with Crédit Lyonnais, he bought back MGM/UA for $1.3 billion. It was Mr. Kerkorian’s third takeover of MGM, and he seemed determined to restore the company’s vitality. But he ended up selling it in 2004 to a consortium led by Sony. \nAdvertisement ",

      "text": "“I identify as black,” Rachel A. Dolezal told NBC’s “Today” show on Tuesday. Ms. Dolezal’s resignation of her post as an N.A.A.C.P. official in Washington State after accusations that she misrepresented her racial background is the water-cooler story of the week.\nDespite having white parents, Ms. Dolezal is sticking by her sense of self. For those who find her story endlessly fascinating, there are many options for further reading. Passing across racial boundaries is a longstanding theme in American fiction and the subject of several riveting nonfiction books.\nPhoto Credit Patricia Wall/The New York Times The most uncanny book on the subject, in terms of timing and plot, might be Nell Zink’s “Mislaid,” a novel about a white woman who starts life over in a Virginia town, passing herself and her daughter off as black. Published less than a month before the Dolezal news broke, Ms. Zink’s novel has generated jokes claiming it’s more than a remarkable coincidence. The writer Emily Gould quipped on Twitter : “Hats off to @eccobooks; this Rachel Dolezal thing is genius viral marketing for Mislaid by Nell Zink.” Robert P. Baird, an editor at Harper’s Magazine, said in a Tweet : “If Rachel Dolezal didn’t exist, Nell Zink would have had to…oh wait.”\nJess Row’s novel “Your Face in Mine,” published last summer, features a white man who has “racial reassignment surgery” to become black. Mr. Row told The New York Times that he wanted “to make the novel the logical outcome of the way certain vectors in our society are going.”\nPhilip Roth’s “The Human Stain” is about a light-skinned black man passing as a Jewish professor at a Massachusetts college. (If you’d prefer a movie about the subject to a book, there’s the 2003 adaptation starring Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman.)\nMany readers believed “The Human Stain” was inspired by the life of Anatole Broyard, who had been a book critic and editor at The Times, among other things, and had hidden his black ancestry during his life. (Mr. Roth denies the connection .) Bliss Broyard’s “One Drop” is a memoir about her father. “My father truly believed,” she writes in it, “that there wasn’t any essential difference between blacks and whites and that the only person responsible for determining who he was supposed to be was himself.”\nJohn Howard Griffin’s 1961 “Black Like Me” chronicled the white author’s journeys through the American South after enlisting a dermatologist to help darken his skin. In 2007, Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post wrote : “Read now, for the first time since 1961, ‘Black Like Me’ has lost surprisingly little of its power. I am more conscious of Griffin’s occasional lapses into clumsy prose and his inclination to mount a soapbox . . . but the story itself remains powerful, revealing and moving.”\nSeveral novels explore the fateful decisions of self-identification made by biracial characters. These include Mat Johnson’s “Loving Day” ; Danzy Senna’s “Caucasia” ; and “Passing,” a novel by Nella Larsen, a writer associated with the Harlem Renaissance.\nMartha Sandweiss’s “Passing Strange” tells the true story of Clarence King, the American explorer and scientist who passed for black in one half of his life. In “The Invisible Line,” Daniel Sharfstein writes about three families in American history that lived with fluid racial identities.\nAt the root of all these stories about larger social issues, fiction or nonfiction, is a sense of individual struggle. In The New York Times Book Review, Walter Kirn wrote that in Ms. Zink’s novel, racial and gender designations “are infallibly irrelevant to the highly individual business of living and loving according to our instincts rather than larger, social expectations. In ‘Mislaid’ everyone is a minority — of one.”\nThe reading list:\n“Mislaid” by Nell Zink\n“Your Face in Mine” by Jess Row\n“The Human Stain” by Philip Roth\n“One Drop” by Bliss Broyard\n“Black Like Me” by John Howard Griffin\n“Passing Strange” by Martha Sandweiss\n“The Invisible Line” by Daniel Sharfstein\n“Loving Day” by Mat Johnson\n“Caucasia” by Danzy Senna\n“A Chosen Exile” by Allyson Hobbs\n“Passing” by Nella Larsen\n“Black No More” by George Schuyler\n“The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man” by James Weldon Johnson",

      "text": " BOSTON — When Boston 2024, the private group organizing the city’s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics, unveiled its plans in January, it boasted that it would put on “the most walkable Games in modern times.”\nWell, spectators may find themselves on some awfully long walks.\nIn a striking about-face, the bid organizers are detouring from their promise of a compact Games and offering instead a plan that spreads the events across Massachusetts. While the International Olympic Committee had signaled that it would look favorably on sites clustered closely together in a small city like Boston — which would essentially serve as its own Olympic Park — the organizers ran into a buzz saw of complaints about many of its proposed venues, which had not been vetted with some of the landlords or the public. As questions mushroomed about the bid’s financials and Boston 2024’s lack of transparency, support in Boston for hosting the Games plummeted.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Support for Boston’s 2024 Olympic Bid Slips, Along With Time to Reverse It JUNE 10, 2015 On Olympics: Boston Welcomes 2024 Olympic Bid With Trepidation JAN. 9, 2015 Details Uncovered in Boston’s 2024 Olympic Bid May Put It in Jeopardy MAY 29, 2015 Now, in its determination to salvage its effort, Boston 2024 is preparing what it has called Bid 2.0. In the original plan, most of the venues were concentrated within a six-mile radius of one another in Boston and within a 10-minute walk of subways or commuter rail lines. In the next iteration, due by the end of the month, more sites will be sprinkled across the state and possibly the region.\nEarly polling suggests that this strategy may win more popular support for hosting the Olympics. But at the same time, it runs counter to the blueprint laid out by the I.O.C., which calls for future Games to be more compact.\nDoug Rubin, a spokesman for Boston 2024, said Bid 2.0 would not go overboard with out-of-town venues and would still produce a “walkable, transit-oriented Games.”\n“When people see the entire plan, they’ll see that that narrative still fits these Games,” he said.\nMr. Rubin, too, minimized any conflict that Bid 2.0 might pose with the I.O.C., saying Boston 2024 was still dedicated to an important I.O.C. principle of putting on sustainable Games with lasting benefits for each host community.\n“Give us a chance to make the case,” he said.\nOn Monday, Boston 2024 announced that skeet and trap shooting events, once planned for Long Island, in Boston Harbor, would instead be held in Billerica, a town about 25 miles northwest of Boston. That followed an announcement on June 4 that sailing events, initially planned for Boston Harbor, would take place in New Bedford, on Buzzards Bay, about 60 miles south of Boston.\nIn the coming days, Boston 2024 is expected to announce more out-of-town venues.\nRowing, for one, might have to take place elsewhere; despite Boston’s rich rowing tradition, the many bends and bridges of the photogenic Charles River mean it does not meet Olympic specifications. Possible alternative sites include Lowell or Worcester.\nOther cities are hoping to get in on the act. Holyoke, the birthplace of volleyball, would love to host Olympic volleyball. Springfield, where basketball was invented, thinks it is ideal for Olympic hoops. There was even talk of using Yankee Stadium in New York and Wrigley Field in Chicago for baseball preliminaries, with the finals at Fenway Park in Boston; organizers are still waiting to see whether baseball returns to the Olympic program.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Even as some venues are moving out of the city, the site for tennis, for example, has been switched from Harvard into Boston, to an African-American club in Dorchester, a hardscrabble neighborhood that draws a diverse clientele.\nSpreading the wealth may help the bid pick up political support within Massachusetts, which expects to hold a statewide referendum next year on whether to host the Games.\nBut some note that the broader field of play is at odds with the bid accepted by the United States Olympic Committee when it chose Boston as its host candidate over Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington in January.\n“This was a bait-and-switch,” said Chris Dempsey, a co-chairman for No Boston Olympics, the chief opposition group.\nHe added: “They’re trying to appeal to a new reality, where they have to win a statewide referendum. The only way to do that is to start to sprinkle these things around.”\nAnd the end result, he said, will be to stick all taxpayers, not just those in Boston, with the tab for the inevitable cost overruns.\nAfter Sochi, Russia, spent $52 billion on the 2014 Winter Olympics, a dwindling number of cities were willing to compete to host the quadrennial extravaganza and deal with the usual litter of white elephants. The I.O.C. last year adopted what it called Agenda 2020, which suggested that future Games be less expensive, more compact and more sustainable, with identifiable long-term benefits for the hosts.\nDick Pound, an I.O.C. delegate based in Montreal, said that moving some venues out of Boston would not necessarily hurt the city’s chances against other candidates, which include Rome; Hamburg, Germany; and probably Paris.\n“Massachusetts is not Texas, so you’re not talking huge distances,” Mr. Pound said. He noted that sailing events, for example, were typically held at some remove from the host city — and all the better if those venues provide world-class sailing waters, like those at Buzzards Bay.\nMr. Pound also said the I.O.C. was not trying to impose a top-down “made in Switzerland” approach.\n“This is essentially a partnership,” he said. “It’s not good for you if you end up with a bunch of white elephants, and it’s not good for us to have unhappy host cities. Let’s see if we can get this done on a win-win basis. That’s the change of attitude since Agenda 2020.”\nSome have indicated that in the eyes of the I.O.C., a bigger problem for Boston than moving venues out of the city might be the sagging poll numbers; only 39 percent of statewide voters in the most recent poll supported hosting the Olympics, while 49 percent opposed it.\nMr. Pound, the I.O.C. delegate, said that that could be a problem but that going out of Boston might improve those numbers.\n“It’s Boston’s meatloaf to make,” he said. “They’ve got to figure out what’s good for them. And it’s certainly fair to reconsider the original idea. As it was, it wasn’t getting much of a positive response.”\nLoading...

      "title": "As Stress Drives Off Drone Operators, Air Force Must Cut Flights",
      "text": " CREECH AIR FORCE BASE, Nev. — After a decade of waging long-distance war through their video screens, America’s drone operators are burning out, and the Air Force is being forced to cut back on the flights even as military and intelligence officials are demanding more over intensifying combat zones in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\nThe Air Force plans to trim the flights by the armed surveillance drones to 60 a day by October from a recent peak of 65 as it deals with the first serious exodus of the crew members who helped usher in a new era of war by remote control.\nAir Force officials said that this year they would lose more drone pilots, who are worn down by the unique stresses of their work, than they can train.\n“We’re at an inflection point right now,” said Col. James Cluff, the commander of the Air Force’s 432nd Wing, which runs the drone operations from this desert outpost about 45 miles northwest of Las Vegas.\nThe cut in flights is an abrupt shift for the Air Force. Drone missions increased tenfold in the last decade, relentlessly pushing the operators in an effort to meet the insatiable demand for streaming video of insurgent activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and other war zones, including Somalia, Libya and now Syria.\nThe reduction could also create problems for the C.I.A., which has used Air Force pilots to conduct drone missile attacks on terrorism suspects in Pakistan and Yemen, government officials said. And the slowdown comes just as military advances by the Islamic State have placed a new premium on aerial surveillance and counterattacks.\nSome top Pentagon officials had hoped to continue increasing the number of daily drone flights to more than 70. But the defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, recently signed off on the cuts after it became apparent that the system was at the breaking point, Air Force officials said.\nThe biggest problem is that a significant number of the 1,200 pilots are coming up for re-enlistment and are opting to leave, while a training program is producing only about half of the new pilots that the service needs, Colonel Cluff said in a recent interview. That’s because the Air Force had to pull instructors out of the schools and put them on the flight line in a rush to expand the number of flights over the last few years.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Colonel Cluff said the pilots were “undermanned and overworked,” sapped by alternating day and night shifts with little chance for academic breaks or promotion.\nColonel Cluff said top Pentagon officials thought last year that the Air Force could safely reduce the number of daily flights as military operations in Afghanistan wound down. But, he said, “The world situation changed,” with the rapid emergence of the Islamic State, and the demand for the drones shot up again.\nOfficials say that since August, Predator and Reaper drones have conducted 3,300 sorties and 875 missile and bomb strikes in Iraq against the Islamic State.\nWhat had seemed to be a benefit of the job, the novel way that the crews could fly Predator and Reaper drones via satellite links while living safely in the United States with their families, has created new types of stresses as they constantly shift back and forth between war and family activities and become, in effect, perpetually deployed.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story “Having our folks make that mental shift every day, driving into the gate and thinking, ‘All right, I’ve got my war face on, and I’m going to the fight,’ and then driving out of the gate and stopping at Walmart to pick up a carton of milk or going to the soccer game on the way home — and the fact that you can’t talk about most of what you do at home — all those stressors together are what is putting pressure on the family, putting pressure on the airman,” Colonel Cluff said.\nWhile most of the pilots and camera operators feel comfortable killing insurgents who are threatening American troops, interviews with about 100 pilots and sensor operators for an internal study that has not yet been released, he added, found that the fear of occasionally causing civilian casualties was another major cause of stress, even more than seeing the gory aftermath of the missile strikes in general.\nA Defense Department study in 2013, the first of its kind, found that drone pilots experienced mental health problems like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder at the same rate as pilots of manned aircraft who were deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. Drone pilots often “witness the carnage,” said one of the study’s authors, Jean Lin Otto, an epidemiologist. “Manned aircraft pilots don’t do that. They get out of there as soon as possible.”\nTrevor Tazin, a pilot who retired as a major in 2014 after flying Predator drones and training new pilots, called the work “brutal, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.”\n“At its worst,” he said in an interview, “it was 12 hours a day, six days a week. Often you are called in on your day off.”\nSome drone operators have struggled with the constant killing, especially when civilians or coalition troops are accidentally hit by missile strikes. But Mr. Tazin said being a drone pilot was “not like being on the ground” during combat. “You are not getting blood all over yourself,” he said. “Your buddy is not getting killed.”\nThe exodus from the drone program might be caused in part by the lure of the private sector, Mr. Tazin said, noting that surveillance operators can earn four times their salary working for private defense contractors. In January, in an attempt to retain drone operators, the Air Force doubled incentive pay to $18,000 per year.\nColonel Cluff said the idea behind the reduction in flights was “to come back a little bit off of 65 to allow some breathing room” to expand the number of instructors again and train more recruits.\nThe Air Force also has tried to ease the stress by creating a human performance team, led by a psychologist and including doctors and chaplains. All of them have been granted top-secret clearances so they can meet with pilots and camera operators anywhere in the facility if they are upset about a missile strike or need help adjusting to the shift work.\nColonel Cluff invited a number of reporters to the Creech base on Tuesday to discuss some of these issues. It was the first time in several years that the Air Force had allowed reporters onto the base, which has been considered the heart of the drone operations since 2005.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The colonel said the stress on the operators belied a complaint by some critics that flying drones was like playing a video game or that pressing the missile fire button 7,000 miles from the battlefield made it psychologically easier for them to kill.\nHe also said that the retention difficulties underscore that while the planes themselves are unmanned, they need hundreds of pilots, sensor operators, intelligence analysts and launch and recovery specialists in foreign countries to operate.\nSome of the crews still fly their missions inside sand-colored and air-conditioned trailers baking in the desert sun here, while other cockpit setups filled with map and data screens have been created inside new mission center buildings. Anti-drone protesters are periodically arrested as they try to block pilots from entering the base.\nAnd if the Air Force is having trouble holding onto the pilots and camera operators now, the complications can only get worse when the number of higher-paying jobs in the nascent commercial drone industry starts to soar, some experts say. “If you think you have a problem now, just wait till then,” said one Air Force officer involved in drone operations who was not authorized to speak publicly about the program.",

Putin speaking Tuesday at the opening of a fair to exhibit Russian arms and military equipment in Kubinka, west of Moscow. Credit Vasily Maximov/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story KUBINKA, Russia — President Vladimir V. Putin said on Tuesday that Russia would add more than 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles to its nuclear arsenal this year, prompting Secretary of State John Kerry to express his concern and NATO ’s chief to accuse Moscow of dangerous “saber rattling.” Mr. Putin made his announcement a day after Russian officials denounced a plan by the United States to station tanks and heavy weapons in NATO member states on Russia’s border as the most aggressive act by Washington since the Cold War. “More than 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles able to overcome even the most technically advanced antimissile defense systems will be added to the makeup of the nuclear arsenal this year,” Mr. Putin, flanked by army officers, said in a speech at an arms fair west of Moscow. Intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, have a minimum range of more than 3,400 miles. Mr. Putin gave no more details of which particular missiles were being added to the nuclear arsenal. He has repeatedly urged Russia to maintain its nuclear deterrence to counter what he sees as growing security threats. Such comments have helped whip up anti-Western sentiment and rally support behind Mr. Putin, but have caused disquiet in the West, particularly countries on or near Russia’s borders that were under Soviet domination during the Cold War. Responding quickly to Mr. Putin’s remarks, Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, accused Russia of unwarranted “saber rattling,” calling it “destabilizing and dangerous.” At a news briefing in Brussels, Mr. Stoltenberg said such rhetoric from Moscow explained the Western alliance’s increased preparedness on the part of its forces to defend its member states closest to Russia. “This nuclear saber rattling of Russia is unjustified,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “This is something we are addressing, and it’s also one of the reasons we are now increasing the readiness and preparedness of our forces.” “We are responding by making sure that NATO also in the future is an alliance which provides deterrence and protection for all allies against any threat,” he added. Mr. Kerry, speaking to reporters in Washington, said, “It does concern me.” “Nobody should hear that kind of announcement from the leader of a powerful country and not be concerned about what the implications are,” he added. Tension has flared anew between Russia and Western powers over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis, in which pro-Russian separatist forces have seized a large part of the country’s east after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in early 2014. The European Union and United States imposed economic sanctions on Russia. But Washington and Moscow are still bound by a 2010 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that caps deployed strategic nuclear warheads at 1,550 each and limits the numbers of strategic nuclear missile launchers to 800 by 2018. The fair that opened on Tuesday to exhibit Russian arms and military equipment was the latest example of Moscow showcasing its modernized armed forces. But lavish military spending is burdening Russia’s national budget at a time when the economy is sliding toward recession, hammered by low oil prices and Western sanctions. The Kremlin portrays spending on the Russian arms sector as a driver of economic growth, but Mr. Putin’s critics say it is excessive and comes at the expense of social needs. Loading...",

      "text": " Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group , did not name the big New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell as a defendant in his lawsuit challenging the terms of the federal government’s bailout of his company during the financial crisis.\nBut at times, it might seem that way from reading the ruling in the case issued on Monday by Judge Thomas C. Wheeler of the United States Court of Federal Claims.\nThe name Davis Polk comes up 36 times in the 75-page ruling — more than any other outside adviser that worked with the United States government in putting together the hastily arranged bailout of A.I.G. in September 2008.\nJudge Wheeler, who sided with Mr. Greenberg on the law but awarded him no damages, described the lawyers from Davis Polk as working in tandem with the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to deny Mr. Greenberg and other A.I.G. shareholders an opportunity to vote on the bailout plan that totaled $185 billion and kept the insurer out of bankruptcy.\nThe judge said the “carefully orchestrated” bailout that gave the government a nearly 80 percent equity stake in A.I.G. was done with the blessing of Davis Polk, even though a lawyer for the firm expressed private doubts about the plan’s legality. Judge Wheeler cited an email from a Davis Polk lawyer in which he said the government “is on thin ice and they know it.”\nThe damaging email surfaced during post-trial discovery after Judge Wheeler ruled that the federal government had waived its attorney-client privilege by putting several Davis Polk lawyers on the stand to testify about the advice they gave the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve in drafting the bailout.\nThe decision to put two senior lawyers from Davis Polk on the stand may have been a tactical mistake by the Justice Department because it opened the door to the plaintiffs to require the firm to produce internal communications that otherwise would have remained private. Several legal scholars said putting lawyers on the stand to testify is often risky, and it clearly backfired in this case.\n“Lawyers are difficult witnesses, and they are hard to control,” said Ellen Yaroshefsky, executive director of the Jacob Burns Ethics Center at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law.\nW. Bradley Wendel, a professor at Cornell Law School, who specializes in legal ethics, said it was fair to question whether the Justice Department had adequately prepared the Davis Polk lawyers. “Whoever was handling those witnesses needed to be more careful,” he said.\nA spokesman for the Justice Department was not immediately available for comment.\nIn fairness to Davis Polk, the law firm also turned over emails in which other lawyers took a position on the legality of the Fed’s action that differed from the view expressed in the “thin ice” email.\nIn his ruling, Judge Wheeler said the testimony from the Davis Polk lawyers necessitated “a waiver as to any previously privileged documents relating to the government’s economic rescue of A.I.G.” Before the trial, the judge had already ruled that the government had waived some of its attorney-client privilege by the nature of the defense arguments it was raising.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Other legal and business experts said the waiver of the attorney-client privilege raised uncomfortable questions about Davis Polk’s representation of the government during the A.I.G. bailout negotiations. These experts said an argument could be made that Davis Polk had an ethical obligation to stop representing the federal government agencies if its lawyers truly harbored private doubts about the legality of forcing A.I.G. to give the government an equity stake in return for what was an initially an $85 billion loan.\n“I think what irritated the judge is the sense of the government throwing its weight around and Davis Polk was coming up with a way to do it,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. “Your client could be gung-ho to want to do something, but in the course of representing a client it is part of the canon on the ethics you need to exercise independent judgment.”\nPeter J. Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School and a DealBook columnist at Times The New York Times, said if lawyers within Davis Polk firmly concluded that the government’s decision violated a provision of the Federal Reserve Act, the firm might have had an ethical obligation to cease its representation. “You could make a reasonable argument that Davis Polk should have quit,” he said.\nBut others are willing to give Davis Polk lawyers the benefit of the doubt, especially because they were dealing with an unprecedented situation and having to render legal advice in the face of a rapidly unfolding financial crisis. The experts said one way to look at what Davis Polk was doing was simply trying to find a creative solution for its client.\n“One of the things lawyers are paid for is to be problem solvers,” said Professor Wendel, who added that clients do not like it when lawyers say something cannot be done without offering another possibility.\nThen again, Mr. Wendel said he could understand why Judge Wheeler might have had some issues with Davis Polk.\n“I get the judge’s tone,” Mr. Wendel said. “There does seem to be a little talking out of both sides of their mouths.”\nLoading...

      "text": "Continue reading the main story United Airlines said on Tuesday that it would move out of Kennedy International Airport in October, after failing to make a profit there for seven years, and will shift all of its flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco to its hub in Newark. The change will allow United to provide its premium services — which it calls “p.s.” — for business travelers in Newark for all of its West Coast flights. Those premium cabins, installed on about a dozen Boeing 757s, are currently available only out of Kennedy. United said it had not made a profit on the West Coast routes partly because its passengers had no options to connect once they landed at Kennedy. It has also faced increasing competition from JetBlue Airways, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines battling over the busy transcontinental market. All major carriers have introduced new amenities on those routes in the last few years — including lie-flat beds and better dining options — in a bid to attract the three highly lucrative markets of Wall Street, Hollywood and Silicon Valley. United said that by moving its West Coast operations to Newark, it could offer its passengers service similar to what they get if they connect to flights bound for Europe. “We believe this makes us more competitive in New York,” said Megan McCarthy, a spokeswoman for United. “We are putting our best product where are customers are flying. We have a hub in Newark that can connect to points all over the world.” The airline is the dominant carrier in Newark Liberty International Airport , which it inherited after merging with Continental Airlines. United currently has 14 daily flights to Los Angeles and 15 daily flights to San Francisco from Newark airport. It has six daily flights to Los Angeles and seven to San Francisco from Kennedy Airport. As part of the move, which is planned to start on Oct. 25, United said it had agreed to sell takeoff and landing slots at Kennedy to Delta, and will buy some slots from Delta in Newark. The airline did not release the details of the transactions, which will require approval from regulators. United first introduced its “p.s.” flights to the West Coast at Kennedy in 2004 and made a big effort at building the operation as a stand-alone business. But it has been facing tough competition from other carriers, particularly since JetBlue introduced its “Mint” business class cabin last year. “Mint was a real game-changer for the industry, and for United it was probably the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Robert W. Mann, an aviation consultant. “This has very difficult economics, and despite the premium traffic on the route it is just difficult to absorb all the facility costs. And with American and JetBlue and Delta having all upped their game, it made it all that much harder for United.” American Airlines flies its newest Airbus A321s with three classes of service, including first class and business class to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Also flying Airbus A321s, JetBlue Airways has also introduced semiprivate first-class cabins to those routes. Delta, which has been vying for the mantle of New York’s biggest airline, has brought in bigger planes typically configured for international routes. United also has dozens of daily flights out of La Guardia Airport to its various hubs, including 15 dailies to Chicago O’Hare, eight to Houston Intercontinental, and six each to Denver and Cleveland. But all flights out of La Guardia face a 1,500-mile perimiter limit, which the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is considering lifting. To accommodate the higher frequency of transcontinental flights from Newark, United said it would move several of its Boeing 757s that are currently flying to Europe and replace those with larger Boeing 767s.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story LONDON — The force is with Bobby Abley, a London-based men’s wear designer who had his first solo runway show here on Monday. Much of Mr. Abley’s collection for the spring and summer of 2016 referenced characters from the “Star Wars” franchise.\nThe film series is scheduled to return to screens, under the auspices of its new owner, the Walt Disney Company, on Dec. 18, with “ Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens ,” which has a blockbuster budget of a reported $200 million.\nA young designer would be foolish to risk the wrath of a corporation mighty enough to sue him out of existence for copyright infringement, and Mr. Abley, 26, is no fool. After his show, in the backstage area, he said that he has received input from Disney and takes it into account for his designs.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage At London Collections: Men, Drinks, Drama and Dishabille JUNE 15, 2015 Burberry, in a Class of Its Own JUNE 16, 2015 “They’re quite happy to let me do what I want creatively,” Mr. Abley said, while the male and female models who had worn his latest creations were in various stages of undress nearby. “Their people sometimes have suggestions and marketing ideas, but they trust me.”\nWhile other, more established labels, such as Burberry and Tom Ford, attracted sharp-dressed high rollers to their runway pageants and store presentations, Mr. Abley drew a motley crowd to his more humble show, which took place beneath harsh lights in a gray-painted basement of the Victoria House in central London and which featured music that relied on a sample of “ Bucky Done Gun ,” a beat-heavy horn-laden M.I.A. track from 2005.\nAfter the fashion news media and other invited guests entered the building, Mr. Abley’s minions handed extra tickets to a group of young enthusiasts, many of them with nose rings, who were in a standby line.\nThe first two expressionless models wore camouflage gear, suggestive of the recent decade of war. But these gave way to outfits heavy on “Star Wars” motifs, whisking the spectators to mythic events that took place “a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.”\nOne of Mr. Abley’s models wore a white T-shirt with the words “Super Dooper Storm Trooper” emblazoned across the front. Another wore a furrily textured shirt with the word “Chewy” across the front — a reference to Chewbacca, the beloved, if inarticulate, Wookiee sidekick to Han Solo. There was even a small backpack that featured the face of the least popular character in the “Star Wars” universe, Jar Jar Binks, a Gungan alien in the series’ 1999 installment, “Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace .” (His manner of speaking, a kind of Bahamian patois, earned the wrath of critics and even many die-hard fans.)\nAsked if he had reached an agreement with Disney to create a “Star Wars” clothing tie-in, Mr. Abley said: “I can’t comment on that. But there might be something in the pipeline.”\nIn 2012, when the designer was two years out of Ravensbourne college in London, he founded his namesake label and was soon part of a group show at the Topman-sponsored MAN runway at London Collections: Men.\nFrom the start, his playful take on streetwear has included references to the Disney movies he loved as a child, including “The Sword in the Stone,” “The Jungle Book” and “The Little Mermaid.” (The designer, who says he visits Euro Disney as many as nine times a year, also has a tattoo of the cartoon bluebird from a 1946 Disney animated feature, “Song of the South,” on the left side of his neck.))\nBut Mr. Abley’s designs are not all sugar and sentiment. They include nods to goth, punk, Japanese anime and the “plushie” subculture, which has made him a darling of the alt-fashion crowd and a favorite of the punk designer Dame Vivienne Westwood.\nWith his oddball designs, Mr. Abley, a man with a shy manner who blushes easily, is a long way from the fashion establishment. But with a patron like Disney, he may, like the ragtag rebel bunch that took down the evil Galactic Empire in “ Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi ,” find himself in power one day, with all the delights and difficulties that go with it.\nLoading...

      "text": "Continue reading the main story “There’s no intrigue, just journalism,” Mr. Vicinanza said in a telephone interview. Many journalists agreed that under similar circumstances, they, too, would have posted the draft. But several Vatican analysts on Tuesday also argued that it was no coincidence that the leaked draft had found its way to Mr. Magister. He wrote a June 1 column that criticized the alleged “inspirers” of the encyclical as being advocates of abortion. He has characterized the Vatican media as being soft on Francis, while writing other columns criticizing the pope on foreign policy and as being overly fixated on himself. “The light is all for him, the pope,” Mr. Magister wrote in April 2014. “Not the institution, but the person.” Giacomo Galeazzi, a Vatican expert who writes for La Stampa, a Turin newspaper, said the leak could have come from prelates in the Roman Curia, the governing body of the Vatican, which Francis is trying to reform. In an interview, Mr. Galeazzi argued that the pope’s enemies on the outside “want to weaken the encyclical’s message while those inside want to weaken the figure of the pope.” Mr. Galeazzi also noted that L’Espresso had published several critical articles of the encyclical in recent weeks, which he called “a pre-emptive strike to an encyclical that has already broken one record: It is the first to be attacked even before it has been published.” Alberto Melloni, a liberal scholar and Vatican historian, said the leak reflected the continuing tension inside the Vatican, where some entrenched members of the Curia remain resistant to changes that Francis is trying to pursue. Leaking the draft was a way of demonstrating the Vatican remains in some ways dysfunctional while also tainting Francis’ reformist credentials, Mr. Melloni said. “It is revealing,” he said. “This shows the daily fight he has to fight.” The big showdown is expected in October, when Francis will convene a major synod at Vatican City to discuss issues related to the theme of family. Much is under discussion, including the question of whether divorced Catholics should be allowed to receive communion. The synod is expected to be a hotly contested event, and many analysts saw the leaked encyclical as a piece of this larger struggle. Marco Politi, a Vatican analyst and author, said tensions had been steadily rising in recent months, especially since Francis delivered a stern address in December, accusing members of the Roman Curia of careerism and hypocrisy. A few months later, Mr. Politi noted, documents were leaked showing the expenditures made by Cardinal George Pell, the man appointed by Francis to tighten controls of the Vatican’s budgets. “This was a sign of this inner battle over the policies of Pell to control all the budgets of the departments,” said Mr. Politi, whose latest book, “Pope Francis Among the Wolves,” will be published this fall in the United States. He noted that the leaked draft also appeared on the same day the Vatican announced it would prosecute its former ambassador to the Dominican Republic on charges of sexually abusing boys and possessing child pornography. Despite it all, most analysts doubted that the leak would bring much, if any, damage to Francis. One senior Vatican official took it in stride, playing down any conspiracy theories, while pointing out that journalists just want scoops. “It has happened before, and it will undoubtedly happen again,” the Vatican official said, speaking on the condition on anonymity to discuss internal matters. “It is not the best situation, but it is not the end of the world.” Nor is Francis alone. In July 1968, Time magazine got a leaked copy of Pope Paul VI’s much-hyped encyclical on birth control, “Humanae Vitae.” According to the book “Keepers of the Keys,” by Wilton Wynn, a former Time bureau chief in Rome, an “unknown man” arrived at the Time office with a copy and offered it for sale. Mr. Wynn said his staff had verified the authenticity of the document. Then they gave the man about $500, “which he gladly took and scampered away.” Time then had a world exclusive: Paul VI had said no to birth control pills. \nGaia Pianigiani contributed from Rome.

      "text": " Photo The man seen in a video image is believed to be the attacker in a series of bias assaults in Manhattan, and the New York Police Department is asking for the public's assistance identifying him. Credit The New York City Police Department The police are searching for a man in connection with four attacks on Asian women in Manhattan.\nIn each case, the victim was struck with a blunt object carried in a bag, according to the police.\nInvestigators are treating the crimes as bias attacks, and a video of the man being sought was released by the Police Department.\nThe first attack occurred last Wednesday, the police said. A 35-year-old woman was sitting near 155 Grand Street when a man tried to talk to her. When the woman ignored him, the police said, the man left but returned later with a hard object in a plastic bag. The attacker struck the victim near her cheek and chin and fled the scene.\nAbout four hours later, a man walked past a 29-year-old woman on Park Avenue near East 30 Street and waited at the corner. When the woman reached the corner, the attacker struck her in the face with the object in a white plastic bag.\nOn Friday, a 34-year-old woman was walking near Second Avenue and East 60th Street at around 12:25 a.m. when the attacker approached her and struck her in the forehead with a white plastic bag containing a hard object.\nThe attacker was seen again in Chinatown on Monday around 4 p.m. when he tried to start a conversation with a 41-year-old woman near 48 Mulberry Street. The woman ignored him, and the suspect left and soon returned with a hard object inside a gray bag and hit the victim’s forehead.\nAfter each attack, the victim was treated at a hospital and released.\nLoading...

      "text": " Being a teenager in New York City has always conferred unrivaled access to adult privileges. No cars are needed to get around town. Over-21 beverages are easily found.\nNow comes another perk for the precocious: a role in city government — if only the lowest rung.\nThis marks the first year that 16- and 17-year-olds can join the city’s community boards, the local advisory groups where the civically minded, the concerned and the merely grumbly do battle against encroaching developers, vet liquor license applicants and air block-by-block grievances. Nineteen of them were appointed as unpaid members after the State Legislature lowered the age minimum from 18 last year, an unusual privilege even in a country taking small steps toward expanding youthful civic engagement.\nTakoma Park and Hyattsville, Md., became the country’s first municipalities to lower the voting age for local elections to 16 from 18, and similar measures are generating interest in San Francisco, Chicago, New Mexico and Lowell, Mass. Several cities, including San Francisco and Santa Clara, Calif., have also established youth commissions or teenage councils that act as advisory groups to elected officials.\nPhoto Gary Reilly, chairman of Community Board 6 in Brooklyn, led a meeting recently at the 78th Precinct police station house. Credit Kevin Hagen for The New York Times But New York appears to be unique in the combination of youth participation and community board structure, which allows the citizenry to play a formal, if advisory, role in zoning and land-use issues, budgeting and the delivery of city services. Residents can join the City Council ’s participatory budgeting process starting at 14.\n“This sets them up for a life of civic participation,” said City Councilman Ben Kallos, an Upper East Side Democrat who sponsored a resolution urging the State Legislature to adopt the measure. He noted that about one in five New Yorkers is under 18.\nBorough presidents appointed five 16- and 17-year-olds in the Bronx, six in Manhattan and eight in Brooklyn, relying on an application, an interview process and City Council members’ recommendations. None were appointed in Staten Island or Queens. Most of the newly appointed teenagers were attending the first meetings of their two-year terms this month.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Some have been in the trenches of local politics virtually since conception. Others were learning.\n“I did not even know it existed,” said Mahfuzur Raman, 16, one of the new members of Manhattan Community Board 11 in East Harlem. “I would hear ‘mayor this, president that,’ and I never really heard about our community boards.”\nMr. Raman stumbled on the concept only after his curiosity about some police cars parked outside a building led him to wander into a committee meeting last year. Like most of the other teenage members interviewed, he cited zoning, development and gentrification, all watchwords in a debate consuming the city, as among his top priorities for his term.\nMulan Burgess, 16, of Community Board 3 in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Ocean Hill, Brooklyn, is eager to address the displacement of residents and mom-and-pop businesses that gentrification is accelerating in the neighborhood where he has lived all his life.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story But his motives for joining the board were equally, and unabashedly, personal.\n“That is one of my end goals — to be one of New York’s chief senators,” Mr. Burgess said, before breathlessly describing his life plan: college; run for City Council; run for State Senate; “and then possibly, maybe, run for mayor.”\nHe paused. “And also, like, being on the community board,” he added.\nThis trajectory is not quite as ambitious as it might sound.\nSeveral of the elected officials who pushed for the law’s passage were once among the youngest members of their community boards, like Assemblywoman Nily Rozic, who sponsored the bill alongside State Senator Andrew Lanza.\n“I’m still known as the woman who passed the 16- and 17-year-old community board bill around here,” said Ms. Rozic, a Queens Democrat. “I’m one of the younger members of the State Legislature anyway, so it sort of fits into the portfolio.”\nMr. Kallos, who read every membership application submitted to his office (“Yeah, I do care way too much about this,” he noted), said he once served on a community board alongside a 16-year-old who, having managed to join the board through some loophole before the formal age minimum was enforced, went on to work for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. And backers of the bill uniformly cited the experience of Scott M. Stringer, who was appointed to a community board as a 16-year-old in 1977 and is now city comptroller.\nSkeptics questioned whether appointing teenagers would trivialize the boards’ work and whether teenagers were qualified to vote on complex zoning, budgetary and liquor license matters. But those who have been appointed said they have received warm, if slightly nonplused, welcomes.\nAt least one board, Brooklyn’s Community Board 6 , which stretches from Cobble Hill to Park Slope, asked the borough president for young members, saying they would provide a valuable perspective. Board membership tends to skew toward those in midlife and older.\nThe board received three teenagers, including Akash Mehta, 17, a Boerum Hill resident. The reaction from family and friends? “My friends make fun of me and call me ‘Mr. Public Official Mehta,’” he offered. “In an endearing way.”\nThe teenagers have the same privileges and responsibilities as any other member, though one, Leila Eliot, 16, said she had asked the chairman of her board whether she should abstain from liquor license votes. (The answer was no.)\n“There are some people who definitely had doubts — the fear that I’ll ask ridiculous questions, that I won’t pay attention during meetings. It’s the same problems you’d have with anybody, really,” observed Ms. Eliot, who has been going to meetings of her board, Community Board 3 in the East Village and Lower East Side, since she was a child and her father was a member. “People just assume teenagers are trouble.”\nThese, however, seem unlikely to disrupt the workings of government too dramatically. Ms. Eliot’s counterpart on Manhattan Community Board 6 , in Stuyvesant Town and Tudor City, Sarah Shamoon, 16, who has completed internships for two local politicians and is committed to a career in politics, was dismayed recently to have to cut short her post-meeting networking to study for her Advanced Placement test the next morning.\nJon-Michael Provetto, a 16-year-old member of Community Board 10 in the Bronx, said, “I think that the community won’t really respect me too much for being my age, but I hope that if I do make a difference in the community, then I’ll gain more respect.” (Among his previous civic experiences: working in the camel barn at the Bronx Zoo.)\nAfter a high school student in 1991 wrote a letter to The New York Times complaining that he had been denied a community board seat, another reader responded and offered a consolatory precedent: As a 16-year-old in 1970, he had been one of a group of high school students named to boards by then Bronx borough president Robert Abrams.\nThe author, Richard Wexler, ended with a word of warning to future public servants.\n“Experience ultimately taught me,” he wrote, “that the annual dinner meeting of a community board is not most high school girls’ idea of a fun date.”\nLoading...

      "text": " Headliner\nGABRIEL KREUTHER The chef Gabriel Kreuther is about to open his namesake restaurant about two years after leaving the Modern, where he earned three stars from Pete Wells of The New York Times. Diners will get a taste of the Alsatian-born chef’s blend of American food and the specialties he grew up with. Dishes on the relatively short prix fixe menu include a sturgeon and sauerkraut tart, foie gras and rabbit terrine and a rack of lamb in hay. “I’ve been here 20 years, so I have put both together,” he said. Mr. Kreuther (shown in the restaurant) does not plan a tasting menu. He is also serving tarte flambée in the lounge area, which is separated from the airy dining room by old Vermont timbers that suggest Alsatian architecture. Another reference to Alsace is the wallpaper showing storks, a bird that nests in the region. (Opens Thursday): 41 West 42nd Street, 212-257-5826, gknyc.com .\nOpening\nDANTE The new owners, including Linden Pride, formerly of AvroKO, have spruced up the 100-year-old cafe with green leather banquettes, but the space retains a vintage Italian Greenwich Village look with its pressed tin ceiling. The menu is now mostly small plates: beef tartare, burrata, flatbread and cold pasta salad. Italian aperitifs dominate the cocktail list: 79-81 Macdougal Street (Bleecker Street), 212-982-5275, dante-nyc.com .\nFUKU David Chang’s fried chicken sandwich shop serves lunch only, Wednesday to Sunday, where the original Momofuku Noodle Bar and Momofuku Ko drew crowds. Here, the crowd is lining up for brined boned chicken thighs marinated in habanero purée, dipped in buttermilk, deep-fried and served on a potato roll with pickles and seasoned butter. There’s a salad of farro, cabbage and kale; fries tossed with Old Bay seasoning; beer and cocktails: 163 First Avenue (10th Street), momofuku.com .\nSOFRITO It was plenty popular during the 10 years that this restaurant spent on East 57th Street, but Sofrito lost its lease last year. The owner, Angela Terranova, has now relocated it uptown to Riverbank State Park on the Hudson River, with a view of the George Washington Bridge. The chef, Frank Maldonado, has refreshed the menu for the sprawling space with outdoor seating, serving more seafood like oysters and king crab, along with Puerto Rican specialties like pernil with rice and beans and some fusion items like a Chino-Latino shrimp roll. (Saturday): 679 Riverside Drive (145th Street), 212-754-5999, sofritony.com .\nLoading...

      "text": "Alexander Burns Photo Donald Trump officially announcing his campaign for the presidency on Tuesday. Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times During his nearly hourlong ceremony announcing his presidential candidacy on Tuesday, Donald Trump was typically bombastic, opinionated and full of praise for himself. The following are some of his best quotations. On Immigration Policy and Mexico “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best — they’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” On Chinese Oligarchs “Hey, I’m not saying they’re stupid. I like China. I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them?” On the U.S. Military Defending Saudi Arabia “I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships.” On Other Presidential Candidates, and Lobbyists “They will never make America great again. They don’t even have a chance. They’re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors and by the special interests – fully. They control them. I have lobbyists, I have to tell you – I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They’re great.” On Political Stagecraft, and the Islamic State “There’s been no crowd like this. And I can tell you, some of the candidates, they went in, they didn’t know the air-conditioner didn’t work. They sweated like dogs. They didn’t know the room was too big, because they didn’t have anybody there. How are they gonna beat ISIS? I don’t think it’s gonna happen.” Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter . Mon.

      "title": "Leak of Pope Francis’ Encyclical Hints at Tensions in Vatican",
      "text": " ROME — The unexpected leak of Pope Francis ’ much-anticipated environmental encyclical has meant the return of something that not long ago was fairly common around the Vatican but had become often dormant during the two-plus years of Francis’ mostly charmed papacy: intrigue.\nWho leaked it and why? Was this the work of frustrated conservatives in the Vatican, as some experts have speculated? Does it portend big fights at a pivotal October meeting in which church officials are expected to grapple with homosexuality and divorce? Or is it just a tempest in a teapot?\n“Somebody inside the Vatican leaked the document with the obvious intention of embarrassing the pope,” said Robert Mickens, a longtime Vatican expert and editor of Global Pulse , an online Catholic magazine.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Pope Francis Calls for Climate Action in Draft of Encyclical JUNE 15, 2015 The Vatican press office was tense on Tuesday. Hours after a draft of the encyclical was published Monday on the website of L’Espresso, an Italian magazine, the Vatican indefinitely revoked the credentials of Sandro Magister, the journalist who wrote a short introduction that accompanied the magazine’s publication of the draft. Vatican officials say the leaked draft is not the final version of the encyclical, which has been barred from release until Thursday.\nLeaks are hardly uncommon in journalism — some would consider them sustenance — and Vatican journalism has been no exception. Most recently, Pope Benedict XVI’s papacy was undermined when his butler leaked documents, in an episode known as VatiLeaks, that exposed infighting and discord in the Vatican. The scandal is considered one of the reasons that Benedict resigned, leading to the March 2013 election of Francis.\nWith widespread global interest in the Francis encyclical — titled “Laudato Sii,” or “Be Praised” — the Vatican had prepared a major media rollout, with a news conference on Thursday morning and the release of the final document. That has now lost some of its steam. Tempers flared inside the Vatican press office on Tuesday, both among staff and a handful of reporters, who criticized others for breaking what they saw as an inviolable promise not to publish before Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The immediate focus of attention was Mr. Magister, who writes a widely read blog about the Vatican on the L’Espresso website and is known as one of Francis’ toughest critics. Mr. Magister said he was simply following orders: He wrote a short introduction to the draft after his boss, Luigi Vicinanza, L’Espresso’s editor, got a copy and decided to go public.\n“Sure,” Mr. Magister said in an interview, “I’m the one who got suspended. I violated a pledge not to break the embargo. So I didn’t object to the suspension.”\nMr. Vicinanza said he wrote on Tuesday to the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, explaining that he, not Mr. Magister, was responsible for posting the draft. Mr. Vicinanza told the Vatican spokesman that he did not feel bound to respect the embargo because he had not received the text from the Vatican. He declined to say where he had gotten it.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story “There’s no intrigue, just journalism,” Mr. Vicinanza said in a telephone interview.\nMany journalists agreed that under similar circumstances, they, too, would have posted the draft. But several Vatican analysts on Tuesday also argued that it was no coincidence that the leaked draft had found its way to Mr. Magister. He wrote a June 1 column that criticized the alleged “inspirers” of the encyclical as being advocates of abortion. He has characterized the Vatican media as being soft on Francis, while writing other columns criticizing the pope on foreign policy and as being overly fixated on himself.\n“The light is all for him, the pope,” Mr. Magister wrote in April 2014. “Not the institution, but the person.”\nGiacomo Galeazzi, a Vatican expert who writes for La Stampa, a Turin newspaper, said the leak could have come from prelates in the Roman Curia, the governing body of the Vatican, which Francis is trying to reform. In an interview, Mr. Galeazzi argued that the pope’s enemies on the outside “want to weaken the encyclical’s message while those inside want to weaken the figure of the pope.”\nMr. Galeazzi also noted that L’Espresso had published several critical articles of the encyclical in recent weeks, which he called “a pre-emptive strike to an encyclical that has already broken one record: It is the first to be attacked even before it has been published.”\nAlberto Melloni, a liberal scholar and Vatican historian, said the leak reflected the continuing tension inside the Vatican, where some entrenched members of the Curia remain resistant to changes that Francis is trying to pursue. Leaking the draft was a way of demonstrating the Vatican remains in some ways dysfunctional while also tainting Francis’ reformist credentials, Mr. Melloni said.\n“It is revealing,” he said. “This shows the daily fight he has to fight.”\nThe big showdown is expected in October, when Francis will convene a major synod at Vatican City to discuss issues related to the theme of family. Much is under discussion, including the question of whether divorced Catholics should be allowed to receive communion. The synod is expected to be a hotly contested event, and many analysts saw the leaked encyclical as a piece of this larger struggle.\nMarco Politi, a Vatican analyst and author, said tensions had been steadily rising in recent months, especially since Francis delivered a stern address in December, accusing members of the Roman Curia of careerism and hypocrisy. A few months later, Mr. Politi noted, documents were leaked showing the expenditures made by Cardinal George Pell, the man appointed by Francis to tighten controls of the Vatican’s budgets.\n“This was a sign of this inner battle over the policies of Pell to control all the budgets of the departments,” said Mr. Politi, whose latest book, “Pope Francis Among the Wolves,” will be published this fall in the United States.\nHe noted that the leaked draft also appeared on the same day the Vatican announced it would prosecute its former ambassador to the Dominican Republic on charges of sexually abusing boys and possessing child pornography.\nDespite it all, most analysts doubted that the leak would bring much, if any, damage to Francis. One senior Vatican official took it in stride, playing down any conspiracy theories, while pointing out that journalists just want scoops.\n“It has happened before, and it will undoubtedly happen again,” the Vatican official said, speaking on the condition on anonymity to discuss internal matters. “It is not the best situation, but it is not the end of the world.”\nNor is Francis alone. In July 1968, Time magazine got a leaked copy of Pope Paul VI’s much-hyped encyclical on birth control, “Humanae Vitae.” According to the book “Keepers of the Keys,” by Wilton Wynn, a former Time bureau chief in Rome, an “unknown man” arrived at the Time office with a copy and offered it for sale. Mr. Wynn said his staff had verified the authenticity of the document. Then they gave the man about $500, “which he gladly took and scampered away.”\nTime then had a world exclusive: Paul VI had said no to birth control pills.",

      "text": "In ‘Odd Mom Out,’ Mining the Upper East Side for Comedy Gold By JENNIFER CONLIN Supported By Photo Jill Kargman at home on the Upper East Side, where she grew up. Credit Isak Tiner for The New York Times \nAdvertisement Most people refer to the neighborhood where Jill Kargman lives with her husband and three children as the Upper East Side. She begs to differ. “I prefer to call it Durito,” Mrs. Kargman said over lunch recently, “for ‘Down under the Roosevelt Island tram overpass.’ ” It’s that kind of off-kilter humor (and her unfiltered, even raunchy, speaking style) that has landed Mrs. Kargman, 40, a starring role in Bravo’s first original scripted comedy, “Odd Mom Out,” even though she had never acted in front of a camera. But then, she is, for all practical purposes, playing herself: a die-hard New Yorker pushing back against the city’s über-rich with a humor that hits very close to home. Though it is unmistakably satire — the show pokes fun at, she said, “the WASPy world of reversible names, Roman numerals and restricted clubs” — Mrs. Kargman understands there is a certain truth to the tribe she so knowingly described over a nearly 90-minute lunch. “The show is not about keeping up with the Joneses, but rather keeping up with the Rockefellers,” she said minutes before she glanced at her watch, yelled a profanity and the words “jury duty” and bolted from the restaurant. Photo Mrs. Kargman and Andy Buckley in “Odd Mom Out.” Credit Barbara Nitke/Bravo “I’m s MORTIFIED!” Mrs. Kargman wrote later in an email, explaining that she had been warned that a tardy return could result in having to serve all over again. “It was like I was on fire and the hydrant outside was spraying!” she said in apologizing. It could easily have been a scene from her show, where TV Jill, like real-life Jill, is late for everything, including birthday party pickups and school application drop-offs. Modeled after Mrs. Kargman herself, the character she plays, Jill Weber, is 40-something Jewish native New Yorker with three kids, a naughty mouth and a non-finance-type husband. Mrs. Kargman’s spouse, Harry Kargman, is a tech entrepreneur, while Mrs. Weber’s husband (played by Andy Buckley of “The Office”) is a lawyer from a blue-blooded family. Like Mrs. Kargman, Jill Weber lives on the Upper East Side, though her extended family is not nearly as successful. Mrs. Kargman’s father, Arie Kopelman, was once the president of Chanel. Her brother, Will Kopelman, is a Hollywood art consultant married to Drew Barrymore; and her mother, Coco, is a respected member of the Manhattan fund-raising party set. In contrast, her doppelgänger on the show must contend with in-laws who upon learning they are descendants of the Austrian “Von Webers” decide to add to the “Von” to their name for status. Also in her sphere are a brother-in-law who suddenly makes nearly a billion dollars backing a company that sells bagels in China, and his wife, founder of a charity called NACHO (New Yorkers Against Childhood Obesity), even though it is frequently pointed out to her it should really be “NYACHO.” The show, which had its debut on Monday, has generated early positive reviews. “Quite funny,” Alessandra Stanley, the chief television critic for The New York Times, wrote this week . The Los Angeles Times described it as “deft and delightful.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Lara Spotts, senior vice president for development at Bravo, said she knew she had to get Mrs. Kargman on a show the moment she met the writer, who is the author of several novels with such solicitous beach-read titles as “Arm Candy,” “Momzillas” and “The Ex-Mrs. Hedgefund.” Even though Mrs. Kargman had little experience working in television, let alone acting (she said she had written a few pilots and had last been in a play at Yale, where she earned her undergraduate degree in just three years), Ms. Spotts decided to take a chance on her. “I quickly became obsessed with Jill’s ability to celebrate, mock and satirize New York all at the same time, while never being meanspirited,” said Ms. Spotts, who quickly discarded her own initial thought of convincing Mrs. Kargman to appear on “Real Housewives” in favor of developing a “Curb Your Enthusiasm”-type show for her. “The best part is she has all these hilarious stories from her life that are real,” said Ms. Spotts, mentioning two dog-walking anecdotes Mrs. Kargman shared with her: one about a dog walker who writes up daily fecal reports for his clients and another about a man who is paid to pick up poop in the owner’s dog-walking wake. “Somehow Jill is just a magnet for outrageous people and occurrences,” said Elisa Zuritsky, a former “ Sex and the City ” writer who, along with Julie Rottenberg (“Smash” and “Sex and the City”), is an executive producer of the show. But Mrs. Kargman thinks her experiences are generally universal — even though not everyone can count Gwyneth Paltrow as a close childhood friend. “I think anywhere you live, from Alaska to the Midwest to the South, the show will be relatable,” Mrs. Kargman said after recalling a “Tots and Tonic” session where a mother accused her of giving her firstborn “liquid McDonald’s” for choosing bottle feeding over breast-feeding. “Everywhere there are these echelons of women who pole-vault over one another by saying their kid is pooing, talking or napping faster than the other kids,” she said. But while the show makes fun of tiger moms, trophy wives and the men surrounding them, from sycophantic personal assistants to intimidating cemetery directors, Mrs. Kargman says she’s simply spoofing the 1 percent of a city she loves. “I am a satirist, not a scientist,” she wrote in an email last week when asked to comment on Wednesday Martin’s just-released book, “Primates of Park Avenue,” which covers much of the same territory — both physical and sociological — as “Odd Mom Out.” (Ms. Martin says she did “field work,” like an anthropologist would, when studying the inhabitants of the Upper East Side, credentials critics are now questioning .) “Rather than an ethnographic study, my take is the humorous side to the quirky neighborhood that I was born and raised in,” Mrs. Kargman said. “The Upper East Side is a culture I know really well.” A version of this article appears in print on June 11, 2015, on page D9 of the New York edition with the headline: The Upper East Side, a.k.a. the Laugh Factory .

      "text": "Rachel Dolezal’s Harmful Masquerade By TAMARA WINFREY HARRIS Continue reading the main story Rachel A. Dolezal, who stepped down Monday as president of the Spokane, Wash., chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., could have been a powerful ally to African-Americans. The participation of white allies has always been important to anti-racism work. By most accounts, she is educated about black cultures and an advocate for black causes. But empathy evolved into impersonation. And Ms. Dolezal’s subterfuge, made easier by the legacy of racism in America, undermines the very people she claims to support. “I identify as black,” Ms. Dolezal told Matt Lauer on the “Today” show this morning. That may be. But actual black people, like me, don’t have the option of choosing. The details are by now well known. Her estranged parents and Ms. Dolezal’s Montana birth certificate confirm that she is white (allegedly with some Native American ancestry). JUNE 16, 2015 Ms. Dolezal grew up with adoptive black siblings, one of whom she currently parents, and she has a biological son with her former husband, who is black. She attended a historically black college, Howard University. (While there, though, she identified as a white woman, even f iling a lawsuit in 2002 for discrimination, since dismissed, on race and other grounds.) Ms. Dolezal eventually appeared to have darkened her skin. She adopted hairstyles associated with black women and claimed at least partial African-American heritage on an application for the Spokane police commission. Photo Credit Getty Images Some people have pointed to this strange case as an illustration that race is malleable. I submit that Ms. Dolezal is a reminder that it is not. Racial identity cannot be fluid as long as the definition of whiteness is fixed. And historically, the path to whiteness has been extremely narrow. The “one-drop rule,” which, for much of American history, legally defined as black anyone with a black ancestor, was used to keep black people from adopting whiteness. Ironically, it has made it easier for Ms. Dolezal to claim blackness without others questioning the assertion. If they are not themselves of a similar hue to Ms. Dolezal, many black people watching her story unfold can recognize in her features a cousin, parent or grandparent. African-Americans vary in appearance from light-skinned to coal black, straight- to curly-haired, keen- to broad-featured, and every possible combination in between. This diversity is partly a result of this one-drop rule. The original intent of it was to protect racial privilege. Sometimes, if their appearance borrowed enough from white ancestors, black Americans could “pass” in white society. But that social sleight of hand came with many dangers, such as the chance that black lineage would be outed in the skin or hair of one’s progeny. Segregation simply would not work if society was fuzzy on who got the nice drinking fountain, the front seat on the bus and the right to vote. In 1924, Virginia passed the Racial Integrity Act , a series of anti-miscegenation laws that would be overturned by the landmark case Loving v. Virginia in 1967. The act defined a white person as someone with blood that was “entirely white, having no known, demonstrable or ascertainable admixture of the blood of another race.” Yet when faced with the fact that many rich Virginia planters claimed to be descendants of Pocahontas, the state allowed that a white person could be up to 1⁄16 Native American. A person with 1⁄16 black blood, however, was still black. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The definition of blackness under the one-drop rule included those with the barest African ancestry. For example, in 1977, Susie Guillory Phipps , a 43-year-old Louisiana native who had been raised as a white woman, was “ sickened ” to receive a birth certificate that listed her race as “colored.” Under a 1970 Louisiana state law, anyone with “1⁄32 Negro blood” was black. Challenged by Ms. Phipps, the state spent thousands of dollars tracing her heritage back to an enslaved black great-great-great-great-grandmother. Louisiana overturned its version of the one-drop rule in 1983. The legacy of the one-drop rule endures in the 21st century. Historic racism may have flung wide the doors to blackness, but whiteness is immutable. According to the genetic testing company 23andMe, the average black American is roughly a quarter white. But even brown-skinned black people with significant European ancestry cannot become white. Who would accept President Obama, raised by a biological white mother and grandparents, as a white man? Precisely no one. Ms. Dolezal may not be able to claim even a drop of African-American ancestry, but the way blackness has long been determined means that few would question a woman who presents as white but claims to be black. She was able to trade on a racist element of history to pass believably as a black woman. In the days since this story broke, many people have been quick to point out that race is merely a social construct — as if that fact changes the very real impact of race on the lives of minorities. The persistence of systemic racism means there are penalties for blackness in America. Black women — real ones — live at the nexus of that oppression and enduring sexism. The gender pay gap is steeper for them. They are more likely than their white counterparts to live in poverty , to be victims of domestic homicide and sexual assault. If Tyisha Miller or Rekia Boyd , black women who were victims of extrajudicial violence, had been able to slide into whiteness — for just a moment — they might still be alive. (Perplexingly, Ms. Dolezal told Matt Lauer that her decision to identify as black was a matter of “survival.” That is rich, indeed.) But racial oppression is not as easy to shrug off as racial advantage. This is partly because America has spent centuries ensuring that certain people can never be white. Being able to shift one’s race is a privilege. Ms. Dolezal’s masquerade illustrates that however much she may empathize with African-Americans, she is not one, because black people in America cannot shed their race. We cannot proclaim the black race a nebulous concept, while strictly policing whiteness and the privileges of that identity. I will accept Ms. Dolezal as black like me only when society can accept me as white like her. \nTamara Winfrey Harris is the author of “The Sisters Are Alright: Changing the Broken Narrative of Black Women in America.” \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .
